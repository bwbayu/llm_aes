They are qualitative when they have quality names. These fall into disconnected quality, i.e. without any natural order such as the sex or degree course character, and ordered quality, i.e. with a natural order, for example the performance or the title of study. 

The quantities have measurable numerical names and are divided into discrete and continuous quantities. Discreet numbers are whole numbers enclosed in a given whole, e.g. university FUs or the number of employees in a company; continuous numbers are real numbers forming part of an interval of which they can assume any kind of value, an example is the duration of a light bulb or the waiting time.",59.0

-quality when modes are verbal expressions, e.g. sex. can be distinguished between disconnected and ordered: disconnected that there is no order of the modalities, for example the sex cannot be ordered according to a criterion valid for all the male or female modalities, saying that male is better than female; while those ordainable that can be ordered according to a criterion valid for all, for example, the title of studies.

-quantitative when the modes are expressed by numbers and have a unit of measurement. They distinguish between discrete and continuous: discrete ones can take as mode only of whole numbers, for example number of members of a family; continuous ones can assume all the real numbers included in a given range, for example the height.

Unconnected qualitative characters are also called non-metric scales, and are distinguished in orderable and nominal, while quantitative characters are also called metric scales and are distinguished between ratio scales when they have absolute zero, so when zero indicates absence, or interval scale that is used when there is no absolute zero but a relative zero, then zero does not indicate the absence of a characteristic but only from where you start to count.

When it comes to probability we can also refer to different interpretations: the classical definition where the probability of occurrence of the event is equal to the ratio of the number of favorable cases to the number of possible cases admitted that they are equally likely (an example may be the launch of a balanced currency where you want it to test the number of favorable cases is 1 while the number of possible cases is two when the probability of occurrence of the event would be 1/2 or for example in the launch of two dice where you year 36 possible combinations and you want the sum of the two dice equal to six in this case the probability will be given by 5/36 as 5 are the favorable cases and 36 possible ones. the second definition is that frequentist dova the probability of the occurrence of the event is the limit of the frequency relative to the occurrence of the event in a succession of independent tests carried out under the same conditions (for example and you want to calculate the fact that it will dedicate in a given year and it is known that in the last 30 years it has snowed 18 times the probability that it will dedicate in that year is equal to 18/30); finally the third interpretation is given by the objectiveist definition; here the probability is the degree of confidence that an individual, according to his own knowledge, assigns to the occurrence of the event. an example may be be bets; that is how much an individual is willing to pay to get Y in case of winning and nothing in case of loss.

To be defined as such, it must respect axioms which are the axiom of certainty, positivity and additives.

The axiom of certainty means the occurrence of the event in a certain way.

The axiom of positivity means that the probability is always equal to or greater than zero.

By axiom of the additive it is intended that the probability of combining two events is given by the sum of the probability of the first event with the probability of the second event. 

Given the axiomatic definition, there are then three keys to interpretation of probability: classical or objective interpretation, frequentist and objectiveist.

Classical probability is such when the basis of probability calculation itself is the equiprobable, i.e. elementary events are equally likely to occur. For example, if you want to calculate the 'turnout of the three' event by throwing a non-six-faced die, the classic probability of the exit of the desired number is one-sixth.

Frequent probability comes into play when you are not sure of the equivalent, so you have to do a number of tests that tend to infinity, marking the success frequency of the desired event. If, for example, you want to calculate the probability of going out head in an unbalanced currency, you will have to make a high number of throws and count the success of the 'head' event. 

Subjective probability is used when it is not possible to have certain data on the success of an event. The calculation of the objectiveist, given the definition of De Finetti, takes place by degrees of belief of a rational individual who is based on the experience and study of the success of the event. An optimal example is the bets, on which you can go to calculate the degree of belief. If you want to make a bet where you put four and you win how much you are given plus one, you will calculate the probability by dividing the amount given by the sum given plus the win.",80.0

The probability is an overall function defined in the S sample space, which has the following properties:

- P(S)=1 (axiom certainty);

- P(A)>=0. per A (axiom of positivity);

- P(A1 U A2 U... ) = p(A1)+P(A2)+... for each succession of two-to-two events incompatible (passion of the additive)

This interpretation results in three other classes that apply to different situations:

- Classical (objective) interpretation: the probability of an event A is the ratio between the number of cases favorable to the occurrence of A and the total number of possible cases, assuming that these are equally likely (all elementary events have the same probability). It generally applies where there are mathematical criteria below to calculate this probability. We can take the example with a balanced coin, I have the same probability for both sides of the 1/2 coin.

- Frequentist interpretation (static): The P(A) probability of event A is the limit of the relative frequency with which A occurs in a long series of tests considered under the same conditions. To check if my coin is balanced or not, I'm going to do a series of repeated tests under the same conditions. I register a 48-fold frequency of head on a series of 100 tests: my relative frequency will be 0.48 approximate to the probability of head occurring. The probability is given by the relative frequency.

- Objectiveist interpretation: the probability of an event is the degree of confidence that an individual, on the basis of knowledge possessed at a given time, assigns the occurrence of the event. It is therefore based on the degree of confidence of the rational subject who, according to his knowledge, defines the degree of probability of an event occurring.

INTERPRETION OF PROBABILITY: the probability of an event A is the ratio of the number of cases favorable to the occurrence of A to the total number of possible cases, assuming that these are equally likely.  EXAMPLE: experiment of the launch of two dice: -A: sum of numbers is 6;-B: sum of numbers is different from 6--> P(A) =5/36=0.139, B=A;P(B) = P(A)=1-P(A) = 1-5/36=0.861 

FREQUENTIST DEFINITIONS: The probability(A) of an event A is the limit of the relative frequency with which A occurs in a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions. EXAMPLE: clinical trials 

-FREQUENTISM INTO: the probabilities are relative frequencies of success in the tests

-IPOTETIC FREQUENTISM: the probabilities are relative frequencies of success on an infinite hypothetical sequence of tests.

The limits are: the tests must be carried out under the same conditions, in the finite or empirical frequent it may happen that the number of tests is very limited.

The probability of an event is the degree of confidence that an individual, on the basis of knowledge held at a given time, assigns to the occurrence of the event. For the subjective probability we can think of bets. The actors are: the better and the counter. In order for the bet to be fair, it is necessary that it is possible to reverse the roles randomly with 0.5 probability, this prevents the player who plays the role of the better, underestimates the probability of the event or that the dealer overestimates it. The bet odds quantify the relative chances for the position and its negation:quotes "" x a y"" in favor of A correspond to a degree of belief for A.",100.0

For classical interpretation, the probability of an event A is the ratio of the number of cases favorable to the occurrence of A to the total number of possible cases.     P(A)=n(A)/N.  An example could be the extraction of an ace from a deck of 52 cards, the probability of which is equal to 4/52.

According to the frequentist interpretation, the probability of an event A is the limit of the relative frequency with which A occurs in a series of tests carried out all under the same conditions.           P(A) n-->infinity= n(A)/N.      An example could be the launch of a die 100 times with number 5 output. In this case, the relative frequency at which the event occurs must be calculated 5.

According to the objectiveist interpretation, the probability of an event A is the degree of confidence that a rational and coherent individual, based on the information he possesses, assigns to the occurrence of A. We could think of bets: the objectiveist probability is the price p that a person is willing to pay, to receive 1 if it occurs and 0 if it does not occur. Considering the x bet and the y win, the probability is x/x+y. ",100.0

The axiom of certainty P(S)=1 indicates that the probability of sample space is 1, so certain event. In fact, adding up the probability of all possible events, you get 1 then you reconstruct the sample space (S).
The axiom of positivity P(A)>=0 indicates that an event to be possible must necessarily be greater than 0, otherwise the event is impossible in fact the matching set is empty.
Finally, the axiom of the additive indicates that the probability of intersection of two incompatible events is given by the sum of the probabilities of both events.
The classic probability can only be calculated if the events in question are comparable (e.g. in the launch of a 6-faced unmade die). In this case P(A) is the ratio between the number of times the event A n(A) can be presented and the number of possible events N.
The frequentist probability is only applicable if an experiment repeats itself several times under the same conditions (e.g. launch of a 100-fold balanced currency). So P(A) is given by the limit that tends to infinity for the ratio between the number of times in which event A n(A) is repeated the number of possible events N.
Finally, the objectiveist probability is given by the degree of confidence that is placed in a rational subject which according to data gives the probability to a given event. (e.g. bets where the probability of x win is given by the ratio between how much you bet (x) and the sum of how much you bet plus net win (y). ",80.0

equally likely.

Regarding probability we can consider three types of interpretations:

	* Classical or objective interpretation explains that the probability of an event A is the ratio of the number of cases favorable to the occurrence of A to the total number of possible cases admitted that these are equally likely, in other words all events must have the same probability of occurrence. EXAMPLE: Suppose we have a nut throw. The total number of possible cases in the launch of a die are the elementary events that can occur when you launch a die, that is the number of the sample space that is 6. If I look for the chance of face 3 coming out, I have 6 possible cases and a favorable case that would be face 3. In classical interpretation, the probability of each face, in the case of the die, must be the same.
	* Frequentist or statistical interpretation explains that the P(A) probability of event A is the limit of the relative frequency with which A occurs in a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions. However, it is not always possible to carry out a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions. To calculate the relative frequency, you must have an absolute frequency and a total frequency. EXAMPLE: suppose we have a coin and we know that 50% (fi 0.5) will come out head and 50% will come out cross. We check, however, that the coin is balanced by throwing 100 times the coin and record how many times the head occurs and how many times the cross. This is the performance of repeated tests under the same conditions. 
	* Objectivist interpretation explains that the probability of an event is the degree of confidence that an individual, on the basis of knowledge possessed at a given time, assigns to the occurrence of the event. EXAMPLE: For the subjective probability, think of the bets.

CLASSIC INTERPRETATION: the probability of an event is the ratio between the number of cases favorable to the occurrence of the event and the number of possible cases, as long as they are all equally possible (e.g. The probability of getting 2 in the launch of a perfect data is 1/6, because there are 6 possible events and of these 1 only is favorable. while getting 8 is 0 because no event is favorable)

The random experiment is any act or process whose single execution results in an unpredictable result. single execution because the experiment must be repeatable and the possible outcomes must be possible to be defined in advance. The result of the random experiment is called an elementary event. The set of elementary events is the sample space. probability is an overall function defined in the sample space that enjoys the properties: 

P(S)=1(axiom of certainty)

P(A)=0 (axiom of positivity)

i.e. probability is always between 1=certain event and 0=impossible event

P(A1uA2)=P(A1)+P(A2) for each succession of two to two compatible events, i.e. if I have two events that cannot occurisnieme probability of union is = to the probability of event A1 + A2. 

from here we draw the rule of the complementary event P(non A)=1-P(A)

Interpretations are Classic: the probability of an event A is the ratio between the number of cases favorable to the occurrence of A and the number of the total possible cases if these are equally likely. If you throw a dice the total number of possible throws is = to the number of sample space, i.e. I want to bet that face 3 comes out I have 1/6 chances of winning. Of course the die must not be rigged and the coin balanced. P(A) = n (A)/N other examples extracting a king into a deck of 52 cards.

The frequentist interpretation P(A) of the random event is the relative frequency limit with which it occurs in a series of repeated tests under the same conditions. If I throw the coin 100 times and it comes out head 40 times this will be the frequency limit. I use it in the forensic field to analyze the NA. P(A) Lim->infinity n(A)/N

 Subjective interpretation depends on the degree of trust that each individual has on the basis of knowledge possessed at a time. you can use the bets X,Y P=X/x+1, i.e. the amount you are willing to wager to receive Y if the event occurs and nothing if the event does not occur.

Each random event is represented by the elements of a subset of the event space. In classical interpretation, however, it is stated that when elementary N events are equally likely, i.e. pi=1/N the probability of event A is P(A)=lim (N tending to infinity) n(A)/N. The frequentist probability states that given N tests carried out under the same conditions, the probability of event A is P(A)=lim(N tending to infinity) n(A)/N.

Thanks to the axiomatic definition of probability, three different interpretations of probability can be made: 

	* Classical interpretation: this interpretation is also called 'objective definition'. According to this interpretation the probability of an event A is the ratio between the number of cases favorable to the occurrence of A and the number of possible cases. Classical interpretation can be applied to games of chance, such as poker, eight.  An example may be that of throwing a die;
	* Frequentist interpretation: this interpretation is also called'statistical definition'. According to this interpretation, the probability of an event is the limit of the relative frequency with which event A occurs in a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions. Frequentist interpretation is widely applied in the field of statistics and forensics. For example, if you want to see the probability of a given NA profile being detected in the population you will have to analyze the NA of many people and on these repeated tests you will have to see how many people have that specific NA frequency.
	* objectiveist interpretation: this interpretation is based on the degree of trust of the subject. According to this interpretation the probability of an event is the degree of trust that an individual, on the basis of the knowledge he possesses, assigns to the occurrence of the event.

If in fact we know that the athlete has trained very much and is particularly strong, then attribute a high probability value to his winnings.","The probability refers to several principles: The probability is an overall function P defined in the S sample space which has the following properties:

Axiom of certainty: P(S)=1 which says that the probability of sample space is 1 (sure measure, is the certain event), means that the probability of one of the possible results (elementary events), is a certain event, for example if I throw a coin with sample space (head, cross) is certain that it will come out either head or cross.

Axiom of positivity: it says that for every A, the probability of any event is greater than or equal to 0, so by joining the first axiom to the second we can say that the probability is between 0 (event impossible) and 1 (event certain).

Axiom of additives: it says that you can add up the odds for each succession of two-to-two incompatible events.

From this definition of probability three different interpretations of probability were born:

-Classical interpretation (objective): which says that the probability of an event A is given by the ratio of the number of favorable cases to the number of possible total cases, which must be equally probable, for example if I have a deck of cards of which I consider only the 7 (i.e. four 7, each for a different suit) that composes my sample space, the probability that by fishing one of the 4 cards I fish the 7 of hearts is calculated as the ratio between the favorable cases (i.e. 1) and the possible total cases (i.e. 4).

-The frequentist interpretation: says that the probability of the event a is equivalent to the limit of the relative frequency with which A occurs in a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions. It is then calculated as the ratio of absolute frequency to the total of repeated tests.

-Objectist interpretation says that the probability of event A corresponds to the degree of confidence that the individual, on the basis of knowledge determined in that context, gives to the occurrence of that event; for example in bets is the price that I am willing to pay to receive one at the occurrence of the event or 0 if this does not occur. ",80.0

Clearly the favorable case is one and the possible cases are 40. the chance sought is therefore 1/40.  Frequentist definition: the P(A) prob of event A is the limit of the relative frequency with which A occurs in a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions example: the probability of a newborn being female is to be calculated. out of 100,000 births there were 48,500 females.

The probability is a function of the whole, in fact it applies to the individual results of the random experiment. The probability has the following axioms:

-of certainty: the prob. of the sample space is equal to 1 because it is certain that an elementary event of the sample space occurs;

-of positivity: the prob. of the event is always greater than or equal to 0 because the prob. is a number between 0 (event impossible) and 1 (event certain);

- additiveity: the probability of union of events is equal to the sum of probs. of events, for each succession of events to 2 to 2 incompatible. 

INTERPRETAZ. CLASSIC or CLEANING: the prob. of an event A is the relationship between the number of cases favorable to its occurrence and the total number of possible cases which must be equally probable; it applies mainly to gambling or in the case of the launch of balanced dice or coins: the prob. the output of an equal number of a die is P(3)=3/6=1/2

INTERPRETAZ. FREQUENTIST OR STATISTICS: the prob. of event A is the limit of the relative frequency with which A occurs in a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions; if you want to see how many times the head occurs by throwing 50 times a coin, the freq is calculated. If head occurs 25 times, f=25/50=0.5 then P(T) is the limit of 0.5. The more evidence I get, the closer I get to the real chance.

INTERPRETAZ. SUBJECTIVE: the prob. of an event is the degree of trust that an individual, based on his knowledge at a given time, assigns to the occurrence of the event; an example are the bets: the prob. Sogg. of an event A is the p price that a person considers fair to pay to receive 1 if the event occurs, 0 if the event does not occur. The bet odds ""x a y"" correspond to a degree of belief for A: p=x/x+y in fact the net gain if A occurs is 1-p, the loss if A does not occur is -p.",80.0

It can be expressed as an overall function P(.) defined in sample space S. The probability range ranges from 0 to 1: 0 is the event impossible, 1 the event certain.
A measure, to be defined as probability, must comply with the following axioms:
> the axiom of certainty, P(S)=1 or the set of elementary events forms the certain event;
> the axiom of positivity, P(A)>=0. i.e. probability is always positive;
> the axiom of additiveity: if I subdivide a set into disjoined subsets, the probability will be given by the sum of the probabilities of individual events, P(AE) = P(A) +P(E).
There are several interpretations of probability.
The classical interpretation presupposes that all elementary events have the same probability of occurrence: the probability of an event is given by the events favorable to the occurrence of that event related to the total of elementary events. For example, if you throw a six-faced die, each face has a 1/6 chance to show up. If instead the event consists of ""an even number,"" then the probability will be given by the sum of the probability of the elementary events favorable to the event, then P(A)=3/6, i.e. 1/2. This is an objective probability.
Frequentist interpretation applies when the principle of equal distribution of probability fails: the frequentist probability is the relative frequency limit on N independent tests carried out under the same experimental conditions. If, for example, I suspect that a die is rigged, because maybe it is composed of non-homogeneous material, I will not be able to apply a classic probability for the exit of the number 1. I will then have to repeat the experiment a large number of times, count the times in which the number 1 comes out and report this amount to the total number of tests carried out. This probability is called statistical probability and is applied in forensic sciences as well as in all sciences using statistical methods.
Finally, the objectiveist interpretation consists of the degree of confidence that each individual places in the occurrence of an event. An example of this is betting, governed by a subjective probability. Subjective probability can be described as the price that each individual is willing to pay to receive 1 if the event occurs and 0 if it does not occur.",91.0

It tells us that probability is an overall function, which we indicate with P, defined in the S sample space, which enjoys the following properties:

AXIOM OF SERIOUSNESS, which tells us that the probability of S (the probability of sample space) is equal to 1

AXIOM OF POSITIVENESS, which tells us that the probability of any event is greater than or equal to 0 (probability 0 corresponds to the event impossible and probability 1 corresponds to the event certain)

AXIOM OF ADDITIVENESS, which tells us that if we have two incompatible events (i.e. that they cannot occur together) the probability of union is the sum of the odds.

According to the classical interpretation the probability of an ""A"" event is the ratio between the number of cases favorable to the occurrence of ""A"" and the total number of possible cases, assuming that these are equally likely (meaning that all elementary events must have the same probability of occurrence)

Es. ""the throwing of a die"": the total number of possible cases is given by the number of S that in this case is 6 (i.e. the 6 sides of the die) and if for example I bet on the exit of the number three, the favorable case will be 1 (which is the face 3): so I will have a chance of 1/6 winning.

If instead I bet on the output of an even number (2.4.6) the favorable cases will be 3 and the number of possible cases will always be 6: eagle chances will be 3/6 of winning.

According to the frequentist interpretation the probability of an event is the limit of the relative frequency with which that event occurs in a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions.

 Classical interpretation:the probability of an event A is the ratio of the number of cases favourable to the occurrence of A to the total number of possible cases, assuming that these are equally likely.

The frequentist interpretation says that the P(A) probability of event A is the limit of the relative frequency with which A occurs a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions. EX: In the head or cross game the probability that a balanced coin falls on one side or on the other is the same. Expressed as a percentage 50% per head and 50% per cross.  In order for the sum to be fair for each euro bet on head, the net gain must be equal to one euro, if the share were (10 to 9) then the bet would be disadvantageous for the bettor and advantageous for the dealer. If the stake were (10 to 11) the bet would be advantageous for the bettor and disadvantageous for the dealer. 

The subjective interpretation: the probability of an event is the degree of confidence that an individual on the basis of knowledge possessed in a given moment, assigns to the occurrence of the event.

The frequentist probability instead is found in the case in which wanting to verify the probability of the appearance of a given event, for example the side of the cross face in a coin, we do not know whether that coin is rigged or not, therefore the frequentist probability explains that the determination of a given event like that of the cross face will be equal to the limit of the relative frequency given by the number of times that event occurred in the n tests all under the same conditions, for example if having carried out an experiment dictated by 100 tests of the launch and the cross face has presented 48 times, we will have to calculate the limit of 0,48.

	* Classical: (this generally applies to gambling) The probability of an event A is the ratio of the number of cases favorable to the occurrence of A to the total number of possible cases; assuming that these are equally likely- (all elementary events must have the same probability of occurrence); example: Let's calculate the probability that, by throwing two dice, you get: a number less than or equal to 3; a number strictly while of 12; exactly 7. We must first calculate the number n of all possible cases. Since each nut can fall on each of its 6 faces and there are 2 dice, the total will be n= 6*6= 36. Now we see pictures of these cases allow us to get a number less or equal to 3, i.e., we find the number n(A1) of the cases favor relative to the first request, The useful combinations gift of 3 i.e. 1-1, 1-2, 2-1. It follows that the probability relative to the first event will be P(A1)=3/36= 1/12. Now let's calculate the number n(A2) favor cases related to the second event. We observe that being the 12 the maximum number that can be obtained by throwing two dice, say that
	* frequentist: (statistical probability) The P(A) probability of event A is the limit of the relative frequency with which A occurs in a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions. For the calculation of the frequent probability, all we need to know is the number n(A) = 7 of the successful tests and the number n=10 of the tests carried out in total; the result will then be P(A) =7/10=0.7
	* objectiveist: is the degree of confidence that an individual, on the basis of knowledge possessed at a given time, assigns to the occurrence of the event. (For subjective probability bets are thought).

-axiom of certainty: P(S)=1

-axiom of positivity: P(A)>=0

-Axiom of additives: P(A U B U...)=P(A)+P(B)+...

Classical interpretation of probability: the probability of an event A is given by the relationship between the individual event and the sample space.

Example: In one urn there are 5 white marbles, 3 red marbles and 2 blue marbles. The probability of distracting a blue marble is P(LU)=1/5.

Frequentist Interpretation:The probability of an event occurring is given by the limit of the sum of the relative frequencies obtained by repeating the experiment several times always under the same conditions.

Example: Knowing that on 100 launches of a balanced coin, 50 results report head and 50 cross, calculate the chances that the next launch will come out head. P(T)=0.5

Objectiveist interpretation of probability: how to calculate the probability, based on data and knowledge obtained previously, that a given event occurs. It's often used in betting.

The classical interpretation states that the probability is given by the relationship between the number of cases favorable to the event and the number of possible cases, provided that the latter are equally possible; an example of this type of interpretation may be an experiment in the launch of the die in which the probability that throwing an unmade die out an even number is 3/6.

The frequentist interpretation defines the probability of an event as the limit to which the relative frequency of the event tends to increase in the number of experiments, so to be able to know the probability of an event you have to resort to experience, in the sense that on a high number of tests, you find a certain regularity. This is also possible when elementary events are not all considered possible to an equal extent but the experiment is supposed to be repeatable several times, such as in the launch of a coin; in this case the empirical law of the case is valid, in which there is a series of repeated tests and performed all under the same conditions and every possible event occurs with a frequency equal to its probability. The objectiveist approach of probability indicates the probability of an event and the trustworthy measure that a coherent individual attributes to the occurrence of the event; therefore the probability of the same event may also be different if given by different subjects. You can talk about the sum that an individual is willing to pay to receive a euro in case of winning. For example, if you attribute the probability of 0.6 to a given event, it means that you are willing to pay the price of 60 cents to receive 1 euro in case the event occurs. ",70.0
"The statistical hypothesis is a hypothesis that is made on a parameter of the population that leads to the identification of a statistical rule that makes to decide whether to refuse or not to reject the hypothesis made.

There are several steps in the verification of the hypotheses:

1- identify the problem and formulate the question you want to see;

2. to formulate the question in statistical terms: to identify the statistics that can solve the problem;

3. propose the null hypothesis, i.e. the hypothesis checked;

4- propose the alternative hypothesis, i.e. the opposite hypothesis,

5- select the random sample;

6- calculate the test statistics, which can be calculated from the sample data as it is a sample statistics;

7- rule of decision:

(a) compare the value of the test statistic with the theoretical values separating the acceptance zone from the rejection zone (s);

or

(b) calculate the p-value and compare it with the theoretical values. The p-value is used to calculate how far away we are from the nothing hypothesis, the smaller and the more distant we are.

If the p-value is:

- less than 0.01 there is strong empirical evidence against the null hypothesis, so I refuse the null hypothesis at the level of significance of 1%

- less than 0.05 there is empirical evidence against the null hypothesis, so I refuse the zero hypothesis at the level of 5% significance;

- less than 0.1 there is a weak empirical evidence against the sposi nulla, therefore I refuse the hypothesis nothing at the level of significance of 10%;

- more than 0.1 there is no empirical evidence against the hypothesis nothing, therefore I refuse the hypothesis nothing;

8- decide whether to reject the hypothesis nothing. In the event that the null hypothesis is rejected it is said that the test is significant, i.e. when the empirical evidence is contrary to the null hypothesis.","When it comes to the verification of assumptions, it refers to the decision to reject the hypothesis or not nothing on the basis of a function of the sample data defined statistical test; in the verification of the hypotheses there are 8 steps: 

1) to identify the problem and to formulate the question to be examined;

2) to formulate the demand in statistical terms 

For example, in the case of a crime where dog hair has been found on the victim and it turns out that the suspect has a dog of the same color as the hair found, so we wonder what the probative value of a correspondence is;

3) to formulate the hypothesis nothing;

This is the assumption that there is no interest, for example, in calculating the difference between two averages or proportions, the hypothesis that nothing is equality. 

4. formulate the alternative hypothesis;

states the relationship of inequality of greater or lesser in comparison, e.g. of two averages or proportions

5) select the sample;

For example, take five hairs from the suspect's dog so he can compare them to those at the crime scene.

6) Calculate the test statistic;

It is a function applied directly on sample data that allows a good synthesis of the characteristic to which you are interested.

7. acceptance or refusal decision;

The acceptance region is the set of all test statistical values leading to acceptance of the null hypothesis while the rejection region is the set of all test statistical values leading to rejection of the null hypothesis. can also be calculated through the p-value which is so much smaller and all the more leads to the rejection of the hypothesis nothing

These need to be verified, accepted or rejected. 

First of all, we need to identify the problem and ask ourselves what we want to look at. Once that has been done, the question will be asked in statistical terms in such a way as to understand what type of statistics should be used. It is then necessary to put a first hypothesis, said nothing and following this, an alternative hypothesis. 

Once the hypotheses are put, you will go to select a random sample with which to verify the hypotheses and from this you will calculate the test statistics. 

Then there is the rule of the decision, or you compare the result of the statistical test with the theoretical parameters, or you calculate the p-value and the result is compared with the theoretical parameters anyway. 

Take these steps, you will decide whether to refuse or accept the hypothesis nothing. 

It is possible, however, to make mistakes during the passage of the rule of decision. These mistakes are made with regard to the hypothesis nothing and are: error of first species, if you decide to reject the hypothesis nothing despite it is true; error of second species if instead you decide to accept the hypothesis nothing despite it is false.",80.0

1) to identify the problem and to formulate the question that you want to verify, on which then I have to build the statistical test. We compare two average samples or one sample with one of the population, or we compare two proportions. We must ask ourselves whether these values we compare are equal or different.

2) Form the question in statistical terms.

3) Define the hypothesis nothing: it is the hypothesis that you have no interest in, in general you assume equality. Therefore, the hypothesis nothing goes to affirm the equality between the two proportions or the two averages.

4) We define the alternative hypothesis. On the other hand, it affirms a relationship of inequality or of minor or greater.

5) Select the random sample. I need to see if the empirical evidence supports my hypothesis or not nothing.

6) The test statistics which can be calculated from the sample data and is a sample statistics shall be calculated. It, for any parameter, is found by making the statistics of interest (the summary of the sample observations) minus the figure assumed for the parameter all divided by the standard error of the statistics that interests us. The numerator tells us the difference between what I observe and what I hypothesize, that is the distance of statistics from what I hypothesized and on the basis of this I have to make a decision.

7) It is decided whether or not to refuse the hypothesis nothing according to two alternative methods: by comparing the value of the test statistic with a certain threshold or by calculating the p-value (the smaller this value is and the more distant we are from the null hypothesis). The p-value gives us the probability of observing a value of the test statistic equal to or greater than the value obtained by the sample, under the zero hypothesis. Less is the level of significance observed and the more I distance myself from what I have hypothesized. Assuming nothing, it is refused for p-value levels of less than 1%, 5% and 10%. If the p-value is less than 1% you have strong empirical evidence against the null hypothesis, if it is less than 5% there is empirical evidence against the null hypothesis and if it is less than 10% there is weak empirical evidence then you do not refuse H0.

In the face of a hypothesis nothing must always be defined a second hypothesis, an alternative hypothesis: in general a hypothesis nothing is what is considered true until proven otherwise. The hypotheses are simple if they express only a value of the parameter, bidirectional because they include both greater values and those less than 5. In other cases you will have a composite one-way hypothesis. We will then formalize the two hypotheses. The test is a rule by which it is decided to accept or reject the hypothesis nothing on the basis of the empirical evidence provided by the observed sample data. We must then calculate the average sample and, in order to make a decision on the hypothesis to be formulated, we must see if it falls within the acceptance zone or in the rejection zone: if it falls within the waste area then we can say that the empirical evidence is in favor of the hypothesis nothing because these values are very likely. The extremes that form the boundary between the acceptance zone and the rejection zone are called critical values.

It is important to follow general rules so as not to make mistakes in the final evaluation: in particular, the statistical tests are formulated in such a way as to minimize the error of the first species, that is to say to reject the hypothesis nothing when it is true (for example to condemn an innocent), considered the most serious error and corresponding to the probability ""alpha,"" and to keep under control the error of the second species, that is not to reject the hypothesis nothing when it is false (not to condemn a guilty person), which corresponds to the probability ""beta.""",70.0

At first I have a real problem and starting from this problem I ask the question on which then I have to build the statistical test.

This question must then be translated into statistical terms.

Later the hypothesis system is defined: nothing H0 hypothesis which is the one that I submit to verification and which is generally expressed as simple hypothesis (e.g. the suspect is innocent) and the alternative hypothesis H1 which is the opposite hypothesis to that nothing (e.g. the suspect is guilty) and generally expressed as a compound hypothesis.

Once you have defined the hypothesis system (H0 and H1) you have to select a random sample because I have to collect empirical evidence, because I have to see if empirical evidence supports my hypothesis or not nothing.

From the random sample data the test statistics are then calculated: i.e. the sample statistics are calculated from the sample data.

Then the p-value (compared to the test statistics) must be calculated: it is a probability and I measure, in a certain sense, the distance of what I observe from what I hypothesized (me the measure in the sense that the smaller this value, the greater the distance)

Then there is the stage in which you have to decide whether or not to reject the hypothesis nothing: the decision can be made on the basis of the p-value (the smaller the p-value, the more I will be led to reject the hypothesis nothing.

It must be determined what the hypothesis is nothing and what are the alternative hypotheses. The statistical test should then be followed. Then we will calculate the sample distribution of the test with which we can know the possibility of a certain result if all the requirements of the test are met. It then fixes the H0 hypothesis waste area and is the significant level. The smaller this smaller area will be the risk that you run in rejecting H0. The level of significance of the test is linked to the waste area, so the level determines an area where the results are unlikely and difficult to find in reality if it were true H0. Once the level of significance has been established and the type of K test is calculated, the KA critical point of the test shall be calculated in relation to the chosen level.

We then have the second type error where the chances of making an error is generally indicated with the Beta symbol.

The assumptions are said to be simple when they simplify only one value of the parameter, while they are said to be composed if they specify a range of values. If we say, for example, that we have a bidirectional hypothesis because it includes both the greater and the lower values of 5, in other cases we will have a composite one-directional hypothesis. We will then formalize the two hypotheses, for example on the mean population parameter μ: 
H0: μ = 11

H1: μ > 11

The test is a rule that decides whether to accept or reject the H0 null hypothesis on the basis of empirical evidence based on the observed sample data. Then we have to calculate the mean sample x and, in order to make a decision on the assumptions formulated, we have to see if it falls into the acceptance zone or the rejection zone: if it falls into the rejection areas we can then say that the empirical evidence is against the null H0 hypothesis: μ= μ0; if it falls into the acceptance zone then we will say that the empirical evidence is in favor of the null H0 hypothesis: μ= μ0 because these values are very likely.The extremes that border the acceptance zone and the rejection zone are called critical values. The statistics used to decide whether the observed sample leads to accept or reject the hypothesis nothing is called statistical test; in practice it is necessary to know the sample distribution of the test statistics under the hypothesis nothing; in general the test statistics is nothing but a good evaluator of the parameter on which the hypothesis was formulated.",70.0

There are several steps regarding the verification of assumptions.

The first concerns the identification of the problem and the formulation of the question that you want to verify, The second formulas the question in statistical terms or the identification of the statistics that can solve the problem and the third the proposing the hypothesis nothing, that is the hypothesis for which you are not interested, is usually hypothesized the equality or the absence of an effect and we are interested in the difference between two propositions for which then the hypothesis nothing affirms their equality. With regard to step four, the alternative hypothesis must be proposed, if one is interested in the difference between two proportions or between two averages, the alternative hypothesis will affirm a relationship of inequality of greater or lesser. The fifth step concerns the cutting of the random sample, the report of a random sample must be analysed in order to test the hypothesis. In the sixth step, you have to calculate the test statistic, which is a statistic that can be calculated from the sample data. The statistical test is a sample statistics which in general must provide a new synthesis of the characteristic of the phenomenon concerned and must ensure that its distribution is known assuming as true the hypothesis nothing.

The last step, i.e. the eighth step, is to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis; in fact, when the test statistic falls into the rejection zone or when the p-value is lower than the nominal level of significance, it is said that the test is significant and rejects the null hypothesis. ",80.0

Prepositions have three fundamental principles: that of bivalence (a preposition can take only two values, either the true one or the false one), that of non contradiction (a proposition can never assume the true or false value at the same time) and that of the excluded third (a preposition must have by force either a criterion or the other, must never be deprived of it).

 Operations can be made on the prepositions using logical connectors, which result in other prepositions of which the value of truth must be studied and the so-called tables of truth are used to do so.  the operations are 5:

1) NATION: it is an uniary operation where precisely I have only one preposition p and I must find its negation, called ""non p"": when p is false, ""NON P"" is true and vice versa. EXAMPLE - p: SNOW IS WHITE (V) NOT P: SNOW IS NOT WHITE (F). The logical connectors to use are ""is"" and ""is not""

2) DISCIUNTION OR MMA OICA: I have two prepositions p and q, the new preposition that derives from this operation is ""P O Q"" which is false when p and q of departure are both false, otherwise it is true. EXAMPLE - p: PO' IS A ARE (F) q: ITALY IS A CONTINENT (F) p o q: PO' IS A ARE OR ITALY IS A CONTINENT (F).  The logical connective factor to use is ""o'

3) CONJUNTION OR PRODUCT LOGO: I have two prepositions p and q, the new preposition that derives from this operation is ""P E Q"" which is true when p and q of departure are both true, otherwise it is false.

- principle of non-contradiction: a proposition cannot be both false and true, the fact that p is true excludes p is false and vice versa. 

- principle of the third party excluded: any proposition can be assigned the true value or false value. A proposition cannot be true or false. 

The possible elementary operations are:

-Negation: Unaria operation because it applies to a single proposition. Given the proposition p, his denial will be a new proposition that will be false only if p is true, and true only if p is false. 

es: the proposition ""the sun is yellow"" has by negation the proposition ""the sun is not yellow,"" the first is true, so the second is false. 

- Dijunction or logical sum: binary operation because it applies to two propositions. There are two propositions. The phrase p or q (pq) is a new proposition that turns out to be false only if they are both false otherwise it is always true.

es: ""Italy is a nation or the Po is a river"" is true because they are both true. ""Italy is a continent or the Po is a river"" is true because q is true. ""Italy is a continent or the Po is a lake"" is false because they are both false. 

-Conjunction or logical product: binary operation because it applies on two propositions. Whether p and q two propositions, the phrase p and q (pΛq) is a new proposition that turns out true when both are true otherwise it is always false. 

es: ""The sun is yellow and the sea is blue"" is true because they are both true. ""The sun is black and the sea is blue"" is false because p is false. 

-Implication: both p and q two propositions. The phrase p → q is a new proposition that turns out to be false only when q is false, otherwise it is always true. The first proposition is called antecedent or hypothesis, the second subsequent or thesis.

es: ""If Milan is a city, then the snow is black"" is false because q is false. ""If Milan is a nation, then snow is white"" is true because q is true. 

- Bi-implication: both p and q two propositions. The phrase p↔q is a new proposition that turns out true only if both have the same value of truth (or both true or both false), otherwise it is false. 

es: ""If and only if Asia is a continent, then grass is green"" is true because they are both true. ""If and only if Asia is a city, then the grass is red"" is true because they are both false. ""If and only if Asia is a continent and the grass is red"" is false because one of them is false (q).

It must be remembered, however, that any proposition must be subject to the two fundamental principles such as that of non-contradiction and that of the excluded third party.

The operations we have seen are mainly five:

1. Denial: it happens when one proposition is true when the other is false and vice versa. 

example: proposition p: ""25 is an even number,"" proposition ""not p"": ""25 is NOT an even number""

2. Disjunction or logical sum: both p and q two propositions, the new proposition ""p or q"" is false when both the starting proportions are false, otherwise it is true. 

example: false proposition p: ""3 is an even number, false proposition"" q: ""3 is a divisible number by 5,"" the new proposition ""p or q"" is false because ""3 is an even number or divisible by 5"".

3. conjunction: be p and q two propositions, the new proposition ""p and q"" is true only if both are true, otherwise it is false.

example: real proposition p: ""Italy is a nation,"" real proposition q ""Po is a river,"" the new proportion ""p and q"" true is ""Italy is a nation and Po is a river.""

to be emphasized that these last two elementary operations enjoy three properties such as that of impotence, commutative and associative.

4. implication: be p and q two propositions, the new proposition ""p implies q"" is false only if p is true and q is false. within this proposition there is a logical dependence that causes ""p"" to be defined hypothesis while ""q"" is defined as thesis or consequence and the whole is expressed through the verbal expression ""if... then.""

example: real proposition p: ""Luca è trentino"", false proposition q ""Luca è non italiano"", new proposition ""p impels q"" ""if Luca is Trentino then Luca is not Italian""

5. Application: be p and q two propositions, the result of the new proposition defined conditional will be true only if p and q both have truth value, otherwise it will be false. This proportion will be expressed through the phrase ""p if and only if q"" where p is sufficient and necessary to q.

example: p: I'm breathing, proportion q: I'm alive, new proposition p involved q: I'm breathing if and only if I'm alive",100.0

True or false qualities are the truth value of the proposition. A question, an exclamation or an opinion are not propositions.

There are two principles:

-Principle of non-contradiction according to which a proposition cannot be both true and false;

-Principle of the third party excluded that a proposition must always be true or false.

Operations of propositions: negation, disjunction / logical sum, conjunction / logical product, implication and implication.

-Negation: both P a proposition, the negation of P is denoted by P delta not P.

P delta is true if P is false and it is false if P is true. 

The operator ""not"" is called unitary connective because it is applied to a single proposition.

- Dijunction/logical sum: both P and two propositions the phrase ""P or A"" denoted by pa is a new proposition that turns out to be false only when P and A are both false, otherwise true.

-Conjunction/logical product: both P and A two propositions, the phrase ""P and A"" denoted by p/\a is a new proposition that turns out true when P and A are both true, otherwise it is false.

-Implication: both P and A two propositions, the implication ""P then A"" denoted by p->a is a new proposition that turns out to be false when P is true and A is false, otherwise it is true. The first proposition is of the conditional and is called prior or hypothesis, the second subsequent or thesis.

Example: If the player scores more than 40 goals during the championship then he will receive a bonus of one million euros.

Application: both P and A two propositions, the implication ""p if and only if a"" denoted by p<->a is a new proposition that turns out true when p and a have the same value of truth otherwise is false.",79.0

The operations we can do on the propositions are:

- The denial. It is the only single operation that applies to a single proposition, in fact we have the proposition p and we deny it.His denial we define as ""not p"" (¬p).The connective that we use in Italian is ""not."" As for all operations on propositions we have a table of truth in which we find that when p is true ¬p is false, whereas when p is false ¬p is true. For example: Il Po bagna Torino (p è vera), his denial will be Il Po non bagna Torino(¬p is false);

-Disjunction or logical sum. In this case we have two propositions p and q that are joined by the connective ""or."" We will have from this union a new proposition ""p or q"" (pq) that will always be true except when both p and q are false. For example: Italy is a continent (p and it is false), The Po is a lake (q and it is false); Italy is a continent or the Po is a lake (pq is false);

- the logical conjunction or product. Here too we have two propositions p and q joined this time by the logical connective ""e."" The new proposition will be ""p and q""(p^q) which is always false except when both p and q are true. For example: Il Po bagna Torino(p è vera), La Senna bagna Parigi (q è vera); Il Po bagna Torino and la Senna bagna Parigi (p^q è vera);

- The implication. In this case we have a proposition p which is an antecedent and q which is a consequence. It is said that ""p implies q"" or ""if p then q""(p->q). The p->q proposition is always true except when p is true and q is false. For example: the footballer if he makes 40 goals (p) then he will win 10 million euros(q), if the footballer were to score 40 goals but will receive nothing what said will be false (p->q is false);

- the implication. We have p and q that imply, and we can say that ""p if and only if q"" (p<->q), the new proposition will only be true if both p and q are true or false. For example: The Po bathes Turin if and only if the Seine bathes Paris (p<->q is true).",100.0

This is according to the principle of bivalentity which states that a proposition can take on one and only one of the true or false qualities. true or false qualities are also called truth value.
Moreover, a proposition to be such must respect two principles: the principle of non-contradiction according to which a proposition cannot at the same time assume true quality and false quality; and the principle of the third excluded which states that a proposition cannot take neither true value nor false value.
The operations that can be done on the propositions are:
1)Negation--> is a single operation, i.e. carried out on a single proposition. ""non' connective tissue is used.
Whether a proposition, his denial or ""not p,"" is a proposition that will be true when p is false, and false when p is true.
An example: The proposition p is ""The Po is a river,"" its denial ""not p"" is ""The Po is not a river""
2)Conjunction or logical product--> is used the conjunction ""e"" and it is said that: are p and q two propositions, the proposition ""p and q"" will be a new proposition that will be true when p and q are both true and false in other cases.
An example when ""p and q"" is true: ""the Po is a river"" and ""Italia is a nation""--> this proposition will be true
3) Dijunction or logical sum--> is used the disjunctive conjunction ""or"" and it is said that: are p and q two propositions, then the proposition ""p or q"" will be a proposition that will be false when p and q are both false, in other true cases.
An example of ""p or q"" false: ""Po is a sea"" or ""Italian is not a nation""--> this proposition will be false
4)Implication--> be p and q two propositions, the proposition ""if p then q"" is a new proposition that will be false only when p is true and q is false, in other cases it is true. p is defined as an antecedent or hypothesis, q is defined as a result or thesis.
An example of ""if p then q"" fake: let's take as an example the clause of a soccer player's contract, which states ""that if the player scores more than 40 goals in the championship, then he will receive a bonus of 1 million euros,"" this clause will be violated only if the player scores more than 40 goals but doesn't receive the bonus, for other cases it doesn't tell us anything.
5)Implication--> be p and q two propositions, the proposition ""p if and only if q"" is a new proposition that will be true only when p and q have equal truth value, i.e. when p and q are both true or both false.
An example: ""Italy is not a nation""(F) if and only if ""Europe is not a continent"" (F)--> will it be true

The logic of the preposition is a science born in classical Greece and deals with the validity of a statement by analyzing the inferential links, especially deductive ones, among the propositions.

The true or false quality that can be assigned to a proposition is called the value of truth.

The operations on propositions are: negation, disjunction or logical sum, logical conjunction or product, implication and implication.

Denial: both a proposition and its denial is given by non. This means that if p is true then it is not false and vice versa.

Destruction: both p and q two propositions, the disjunction is indicated with the symbol ""V,"" then pq (p or q). The disjunction pq is false if they are both false, otherwise it is true.

Conjunction: both p and q two propositions, the conjunction is indicated with the symbol ""^,"" then p^q (p and q). The conjunction is true only if they are both true, otherwise it is false.

Application: be p and q two propositions, the implication is indicated p -->q (p implies q), this means that the implication is false if q is false because q is necessary for p.

Application: be p and q two propositions, the implication is indicated with p<->q, this means that the implication is true only if they are both true.

Example of denial: Rome is the capital of Italy is true. His denial ""Rome is not the capital of Italy"" is false.

Example disjunction: The snow is white or Abruzzo is a state. It's true because the first one is true.

Conjunction: The snow is white and Abruzzo is a region. It's true because both are true.

Application: If the snow is white then the Po is a river. It's true because the second is true.

Application: If and only if the Po is a river, Abruzzo is a region. It's true because both are true.",100.0

Another operation is the conjunction, where the logical connective ""e"" is used, given a proposition p and q, it will only be true if both are true, for example it will be true if I say the little is a river and the birds fly. Disjunction uses logical connective ""or"" given a proposition p or q, it will be false only when both will be false, it will be false if I say the po is not a river or the birds do not fly. Then we have the implication, where p is an antecedent and q a consequence. In this case, terms such as ""if p, then q"" are used. In this case the proposition will be false if the predecessor p will be true and the consequent q false. For example, if I say that a footballer has a clause that if he scores 30 goals then he will receive economic bonuses, in this case the proposition will be false only if the player scored 30 goals will not receive the bonus. Then we have the bi-implication that uses terms of the type ""p if and only if q"" and in this case the proposition will be true only if both p and q are either true or both false.

Another aspect is to determine, given certain premises, other propositions that are their logical consequence.

A proposition is said to be a statement to which the false value can be matched by an objective criterion. The true or false quality that can be associated with a proposition is said to be the truth value of the proposition.

The term proposition indicates a statement to which the true value or false value can be matched.

On the propositions you can perform several operations that take the name of logical connectors and are:

- NATION. Only one proposition (p) is considered in the denial. The negation of p is referred to as ""not p""; it is not true if p is false and is false if p is true.

example: p=Roma is the capital of Italy not p=Roma is not the capital of Italy.

-Dissolution. In disjunction two propositions (p and q) are taken into consideration which are referred to as ""p or q."" Disjunction is false when both are false otherwise it is true.

example: p=Roma is a nation(F) q=The Po is a lake(F) p or q=Roma is a nation or the Po is a lake(F)

-CONUNTION. In conjunction the propositions are joined as ""p and q."" The proposition p and q is true when both are true otherwise it is false.

example: p=Roma is the capital of Italy (V) q=The Po is a river(V) p and q=Roma is the capital of Italy and the Po is a river (V)

- IMPLICATION. In the implication there are two propositions that are called hypotheses and thesis. They are referred to as ""p then q."" If p then q is false when p is true and q is false, otherwise it is true.

example: p=The Po is a river(V) q=Italy is a continent(F) p then q=If the Po is a river then Italy is a continent(F)

- BILMPLICATION. In implication p implies q and q implies p. It is true when p and q are both true or false.

example: p=Italy is a nation(V) q=The Po is a river(V) p implies q=Italy is a nation if and only if the Po is a river(V).",100.0

This logic is based on two principles: the principle of non-contradiction or that a proposition cannot be true or false at the same time; the principle of the excluded third party or that a proposition can be either true or false, there are no other possibilities. Operations related to propositions are defined as elementary or logical connective, on which a table of truth is used. In each one there is the recognition of a connective, or an expression of the language in which a proposition is obtained composed from one or more propositions given. The operations are as follows: 
1) Denial, which works on a single proposition ""p,"" whose denial is ""not p; in this case the connective is ""not""; When p is true, the ""non p"" is false, and vice versa. Example: p->The sun is a star, not p-> the sun is not a star. 

2) Disjunction or logical sum, which works on two propositions ""pvq,"" p or q ""pvq"" is false only when both p and q are false. In this case the connective is ""or""; Example: p-> men have two arms, q-> the sun sets, in this case pvq is true. 

3) Conjunction or logical product, which works on two propositions p^q, p and q; p^q is true only when both p and q are true. in this case the connective tissue is ""e'. Example:p-> banana is a fruit;q->vegetarians eat meat. in this case p^q is false, because p is true but q is false.

 4) Application or conditional, which works on two propositions p->q, if p(thesis) then q (thesis,consequence). It is false only when p is true and q is false. Example p: a student studies to achieve maturity; q: will not fail. From the syntactic point of view there is no need for the implication to be meaningful. 5) Bi-implication, which also works on two propositions p<->q, p if and only if q; it is true only if both p and q are both true or both false.

operations on propositions may be: negation; disjunction; conjunction; implication;implication.

1.The negation is an operation defined as unaria because it works on a single proposition.

is p a proposition, the negation of p is denoted by -p.

the form proposition -p is true if p is false, and it is false when p is true.

given the proposition ""Roma is the capital of Italy"" its denial will be: ""Roma is not the capital of Italy""

2. In disjunction or logical sum:

are p and q two propositions, the phrase ""p or q"" is called by pq, it is a new proposition that turns out to be false when p and q are both false. 

example: given two propositions p ""Po is a sea"" and q ""Italy is a continent"" then pq will be ""Po is a sea or Italy is a continent""

3.in conjunction or logical product:

are p and q two propositions, the phrase p and q is called p^q. the proposition turns out true when p and q are both true otherwise it is false

example: given two propositions p""The Po is a river(Vera)"" and q""Italy is a nation(true)"" then p^q ""Italy is a nation and the po is a river"" true.

4.In the implication, give two propositions p and q, where p is said to be prior hypothesis and the second subsequent or thesis.

the p->q implication is false when p is true. It says ""p implies q""

When NA is found at the crime scene, the accuser's fallacy consists in exchanging the probability that the NA belongs to a particular subject, with the probability that that subject is guilty, therefore in wanting to believe that the genetic material found at the crime scene, necessarily belongs to the killer. 

It concerns the misunderstanding of probabilistic information: the error arises when you exchange the probability of having the characteristics of guilt with the probability of being guilty, precisely because in possession of the characteristics of guilt. 

e.g. in 1894 Dreyfus, an officer of Jewish origin, was accused of revealing secrets related to the German defense. A forensic expert calculated the probability of obtaining that particular combination of letters found in the document belonging to Dreyfus, assuming the latter's innocence and that that combination of letters was random.

Specifically in the judicial process, laboratory analysis tends to be considered as highly reliable evidence, and that is why it is often a fallacy of the accuser. in particular, this fallacy is found when the judge is presented with evidence analysed in the laboratories that lead to the individualization of a guilty person, but without taking into account the possible uncertainties found in them. Here another problem can also be connected here: that of non-distinctive, which should be done, between classification and individualization, where the first is to indicate a class of individuals who have the same trait including the suspect himself, while the individualization refers to the identification of a specific individual as guilty.

An example of the accuser's fallacy is the case of Troy Brown, who was suspected of raped a 9-year-old girl.
The evidence against him was just starting, except for a match from NA. Despite this a verdict of guilt was issued mainly because of the claim supported by the prosecution, which said that there was only one NA profile out of 3 million compatible with the one found. Here is a clear example of the accuser's fallacy because the random match probability has been calculated, which is the probability that a person chosen at random has the same blood type as the one found at the crime scene, but it has been interpreted as the probability of innocence given the evidence. That's because if the defendant had been innocent, there would have been one in every 3 million chance of finding a match. But such correspondence does not necessarily imply that there is only one in every 3 million chance that the accused is innocent since a correspondence has been found. Moreover, the random match probability does not refer to the final hypothesis that the accused is innocent or guilty, but only to the origin of the trace of NA.

The Bayesian approach is summarized as follows: the relationship between the probabilities a posteriori (probability that the hypothesis of the prosecution has occurred given the evidence, divided by the probability that the hypothesis of the defense has occurred taking into account the proof) is equal to the product of the relationship between the probabilities a priori (presumption of innocence in which the evidence is not considered) and the relationship of probability (i.e. the probability that there is a match of NA, taking into account the hypothesis of the accusation and the defense). 

The accuser's fallacy consists of calculating P(E""HD), i.e. the probability that there is a NA match taking into account the hypothesis of innocence, and interpreting it as the suspect's probability of innocence, taking into account the evidence. 

an example is the case of Lucia de B.: the statistician considers 1 out of 342 million as the probability of Lucia's innocence taking into account the test, in fact that number is P(E""HD), that is the probability that there is a NA match even if Lucia is innocent.",100.0
"The fallacy of the accuser is a very common example of error (cognitive bias in the forensic field) that occurs particularly during the trials and consists in calculating, assuming that the accused is innocent, the probability of proof given by the hypothesis of the defense (the probability that there may be a match of NA if the accused is innocent) and reinterpreted as the probability of innocence given the evidence (the probability that he is innocent if there is a match of NA).
There is therefore an exchange of roles: in the first case the conditioning event is innocence while the conditioned event is evidence, in the second case they are reversed.
An example of the accuser's fallacy is the case of Troy Brown (in the USA) who had been imprisoned for sexual assault on a 9-year-old girl. The evidence in support of his guilt was all circumstantial except for the evidence given by the coincidence of NA (the only evidence of his guilt: Brown's NA was identical to the one found at the crime scene).
Despite this, the jury issued a guilty verdict mainly on the basis of the prosecution's attorney's testimony that only 1 out of 3 million (MP: random match probability) of people had a NA profile corresponding to that found, so the probability that Brown was innocent was equal to 1 out of 3 million.
In the appeal process, the defense attorney argued that the conclusions drawn on the basis of the statistics quoted by the prosecution's attorney were incorrect and were an example of the accuser's fallacy.
The Supreme Court in justifying the decision explained this fallacy by stating that the error of the pm is given by the hypothesis that the MP is the same probability that the defendant was not the source of the NA sample. The mistake is that the probability of such correspondence, given the evidence, is also the probability that the NA sample at the crime scene comes from someone other than Brown. If it is true that the accused was innocent, then there would be a probability in 3 million of a correspondence of NA and MP does not refer to the final hypothesis that the accused was innocent or guilty, but only at the origin of the trace of NA.

An example of the accuser's fallacy is the case of Troy Brown (in the USA) who had been imprisoned for sexual assault on a 9-year-old girl. The evidence in support of his guilt was all circumstantial except for the evidence given by the coincidence of NA (the only evidence of his guilt: Brown's NA was identical to the one found at the crime scene).
Despite this, the jury issued a guilty verdict mainly on the basis of the prosecution's attorney's testimony that only 1 out of 3 million (MP: random match probability) of people had a NA profile corresponding to that found, so the probability that Brown was innocent was equal to 1 out of 3 million.
In the appeal process, the defense attorney argued that the conclusions drawn on the basis of the statistics quoted by the prosecution's attorney were incorrect and were an example of the accuser's fallacy.
The Supreme Court in justifying the decision explained this fallacy by stating that the error of the pm is given by the hypothesis that the MP is the same probability that the defendant was not the source of the NA sample. The mistake is that the probability of such correspondence, given the evidence, is also the probability that the NA sample at the crime scene comes from someone other than Brown. If it is true that the accused was innocent, then there would be a probability in 3 million of a correspondence of NA and MP does not refer to the final hypothesis that the accused was innocent or guilty, but only at the origin of the trace of NA.
The accuser's fallacy consists in calculating P(E""Hd) = P(evidence"" innocence) and reinterpreted as P(innocence"" evidence) where Hd: defence hypothesis and E: evidence, evidence.","A fallacy of the accuser (or conditional transposed) means an error that is made in the application of the Bayes theorem and that consists in calculating P(E""Hd) (probability of evidence since the accused is innocent) and interpreting it as P(Hd""E) (probability that the accused is innocent given the evidence). In particular, in order to explain what is meant it is possible to refer to a historical case of fallacy of the accuser, that is to say that relating to the Dreyfus case. He was an officer of Jewish origin employed at the French Ministry of War, who was accused of having revealed secrets related to the defense to the Germans, following the discovery of an anonymous and undated memorandum. Marie Bastien cleaning woman, at the embassy decided, after the discovery of the bordered in a trash paper basket, to forward it to the major. On October 13, 1894, Dreyfus was accused of having written the bordered letter and, above all, he thought that the bordered letter contained an encrypted message, as the letters of the alphabet appeared more frequently than they would in the normal French prose. In this regard Berillio decided to try to calculate the probability that those letters had been combined in that particular way by chance and that the defendant was therefore innocent. The calculation provided for binomial distributions and was obtained in fact a value of 1/625. It was considered too small a value and therefore the defendant was innocent. In fact, the fallacy of the accuser was occurring as the conditioner was being exchanged with the conditioner. In a second appeal in 1904 a memory written by three wise men did justice to this fallacy, affirming the correct principle of truthfulness. Garbolino rebuilt the case and posed as P(A)=1/100 E P(ONA)=99/100. It was then passed from an evidentiary value to a ratio of the probabilities a posteriori, indicating how the defendant was 6 times more guilty and therefore from these data the calculation of the probability that the defendant was guilty given the evidence.",100.0

The sampling scheme in this case is that of extraction from an urn, and before extraction the sample unit is a random variable that will have a probability distribution equal to the frequency distribution of the variable X studied in the population. If I assume to repeat the extraction n times, to have a sample with greater number to one, and perform the extraction with re-entry in such a way that the different extractions are independent from each other, I will have that the random variables that make up the sample are all independent and identically distributed (i.i.d).

For example, if you want to perform a clinical test to evaluate the effectiveness of a new medicine in terms of healing or not healing, where the probability of success, then of healing, is ""p"" and the probability of failure, then of not healing"" is (1-p). If you give the medicine to a patient this will be a random variable that will be distributed as a Bernoulli and in case of healing it will take value 1 and in case of non-healing it will take value 0.
If I hypothesize the test to n patients with similar characteristics, they will all be individually equal chances of success or failure, so they will all be random variables independent and identically distributed (i.i.d)
In the case of sampling from the theoretical population I cannot make a choice but I have to make a sample survey, because if, for example, I wanted to determine the lifespan of light bulbs produced by a company and assume to do them on all the bulbs produced, it would mean to turn on and measure the time that comes to their break, but in this way destroy production and it would not be a reasonable behavior.",100.0

In finite population sampling the generating population is given by the ""totality"" of the elements constituting the statistical collective in which the parameters of the population are constants.
The population consists of a finite number of clearly identifiable and labelled individuals (i.i.d.) and pre-existing to the observation that it provides the sample data; the characteristic of interest of the population, which is to be estimated on the basis of partial information that is obtained from the sample, takes the parameter name and this represents the unknown aspect of the probability law (but there are cases in which although the number is finished there is no archive for which they are not identifiable or labelable es clandestine, tax evaders).
In theoretical population sampling instead the generating population is given by the descriptive probabilistic model of the v.c. X associated with the experiment and is indicated with fX (x; theta) where theta represents the parameter.
The data are generated by an experiment and would not exist without this; the result of this experiment is random and governed by probability law and its objective is to produce data with which to evaluate the unknown aspects of the probability law that govern the phenomena of interest.","There is a population consisting of a finite number of clearly identifiable and labelled individuals.The reference population is pre-existing to the observation that provides sample data. For example: voters of the country, students of the degree course. Selecting a small part of individuals, you will detect on these the character of interest. such as:vote, height, group sanguinis...

The characteristic of interest in the population that is to be estimated on the basis of the partial information obtained from the sample, takes the parameter name. For example: proportion,average,percentage... the lot of a unit from an N unit population generates a V.C. whose probability distribution is identical to the relative frequency distribution of character in the population.

The constant characteristics of the v.c. X are equal to those of the x character in the population. If one thinks of returning n times the extraction with reinsertion of one unit of the population to each of these n extractions will be associated a v.c. xi,i =1. Since extraction is with probability reinsertion, n.v.c. are independent and all have the same probability distribution.

The dai are generated by an experiment and would not exist without this. The objective of the experiment is to produce data with which to evaluate the aspects not known to the laws of probability that govern phenomena of interest.. In the sample of the finished population the generating population is given by the statistical collective constituted by the totality of the elements.

In particular we have that finite population sampling is precisely created by a finite number of individuals, clearly identifiable and labelled. For example, the population of a region, the number of students enrolled in a university course, etc. In case of finite population sampling we proceed going to consider a small part of individuals and on it to detect a character of interest (vote, height, blood type,..) that we can define as a parameter and on which we go to make an estimate based on the data of the random sample. If you consider drawing lots of units from the population we will have that the character of interest will be a vc that will take value x1,x2...xk, associated with probabilities p1,p2...pk, where pi=fi (relative frequency). In addition, if unit extractions are considered from the population with reintegration, each extraction will be associated with a vc and therefore the nvc will be independent and identically distributed. In the case of theoretical population sampling instead, the population is generated by the experiment and would not exist without it (e.g. case of drug administration to patients to assess their effectiveness). The outcome is of a random type governed by a law of probability, and also the objective is to study the unknown aspects of the law of probability and these unknown aspects are defined as a parameter. If you consider performing a clinical trial in patients to determine their effectiveness in terms of healing, we will have that each outcome will be described by means of a vc of berboulli. Therefore we will have that in case of healing the variable will take value 1 with probability p and in case of not healing therefore of failure the variable will take value 0 with probability 1-p. Moreover if we consider to repeat the experiment on a number of patients with similar characteristics, compared to the factors that could concur, together with the therapy, we will have that every result will be described by the distribution of Bernoulli. Having the same distribution we will have that the n random variables will be independent and identically distributed.",100.0

The population consists of a finite number of clearly identifiable and labelled individuals (i.i.d.) and pre-existing to the observation that it provides the sample data; the characteristic of interest of the population, which is to be estimated on the basis of partial information that is obtained from the sample, takes the parameter name and this represents the unknown aspect of the probability law (but there are cases in which although the number is finished there is no archive for which they are not identifiable or labelable es clandestine, tax evaders).
In theoretical population sampling instead the generating population is given by the descriptive probabilistic model of the v.c. X associated with the experiment and is indicated with fX (x; theta) where theta represents the parameter.
The data are generated by an experiment and would not exist without this; the result of this experiment is random and governed by probability law and its objective is to produce data with which to evaluate the unknown aspects of the probability law that govern the phenomena of interest.","Meanwhile, the population refers to the population generating sample data.

The finite population is already defined by pre-existing and easily identifiable and labelled characters such as the citizens of a region; then they analyse and define the information they want to draw, for example: blood group of that population; finally they analyze the data according to the purpose of the experiment as it can be, for example, a proportion.

By theoretical population instead it refers to the generating population of random variables in X for N possible experiments.",40.0

The reference population is pre-existing to the observation that provides sample data. Es/ electors of the country or a student of the degree course. Appropriately selecting a small part of individuals, it is noted on these the character of interest (e.g. photos, height, blood type). The characteristic of interest in the population, which we want to estimate on the basis of the partial information obtained from the sample, takes the name of parameter (proportion, average, percentage).

In theoretical population sampling data are generated by an experiment and would not exist without this. the result of the experiment is of a random type governed by a law of probability. the objective of the experiment is to produce data with which to evaluate the aspects not known by the laws of probability that govern the phenomena of interest.
