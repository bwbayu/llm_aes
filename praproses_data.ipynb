       "'Reference Answer: probability is an overall function defined in sample space S, which enjoys the following properties: P(S)=1 axiom of certainty, P(A)=0 for each Axiom of positive P(A1uA2u..) = P(A1)+P(A2)... for each succession of two-to-two events incompatible (axiom of additives): Classical definition: the probability of an event A is the ratio between the number of cases favorable to redo A and the total number of possible cases, assuming that these are equally likely an example of application of this definition is the extraction of a card from a deck of 40 cards total.We assume that we want to calculate that the eight sticks comes out. Clearly the favorable case is one and the possible cases are 40. the chance sought is therefore 1/40.\\xa0 Frequentist definition: the P(A) prob of event A is the limit of the relative frequency with which A occurs in a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions example: the probability of a newborn being female is to be calculated. out of 100,000 births there were 48,500 females. As the number of tests is high enough and each test is independent of the other, we use the frequentist definition. Subjectivity Interpretation: The probability of an event is the degree of trust that an individual, based on the knowledge he possesses at a given time, assigns to the occurrence of the event an example of this is the probability that an athlete will win the race. It will be a personal and subjective evaluation, based on some findings that each of us can make. If in fact we know that the athlete has trained very much and is particularly strong, then attribute a high probability value to his winnings.\\nStudent Answer: Axiomatic probability is an overall function defined in the sample space.\\n\\n\\xa0Classical interpretation:the probability of an event A is the ratio of the number of cases favourable to the occurrence of A to the total number of possible cases, assuming that these are equally likely. EX: Experimenting the launch of an unmade die, the probability that esc 1 is 1/6, the probability that it will come out a greater number of two is 4/6=2/3, the probability that it will come out an even number is 3/6=1/2\\xa0\\n\\nThe frequentist interpretation says that the P(A) probability of event A is the limit of the relative frequency with which A occurs a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions. EX: In the head or cross game the probability that a balanced coin falls on one side or on the other is the same. Expressed as a percentage 50% per head and 50% per cross.\\xa0 In order for the sum to be fair for each euro bet on head, the net gain must be equal to one euro, if the share were (10 to 9) then the bet would be disadvantageous for the bettor and advantageous for the dealer. If the stake were (10 to 11) the bet would be advantageous for the bettor and disadvantageous for the dealer.\\xa0\\n\\nThe subjective interpretation: the probability of an event is the degree of confidence that an individual on the basis of knowledge possessed in a given moment, assigns to the occurrence of the event. EX: If the probability of winning a horse for a better is 0.2 it means that he is willing to pay for example 20 euros to win 100 in case of victory of the horse.\\nGrading Rubric: 0-100 (where 0 is the lowest score and 100 is the highest).\\nScores given by experts: 59.0'"
