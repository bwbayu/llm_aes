In postfix notation, an operator is written after its operands. The sum of a and b is written a b plus.You may have seen this as reverse Polish notation.Postfix notation forms the conceptual basis for the way that arithmetic expressions are evaluated by a computer.

They are qualitative when they have quality names. These fall into disconnected quality, i.e. without any natural order such as the sex or degree course character, and ordered quality, i.e. with a natural order, for example the performance or the title of study. 

The quantities have measurable numerical names and are divided into discrete and continuous quantities. Discreet numbers are whole numbers enclosed in a given whole, e.g. university FUs or the number of employees in a company; continuous numbers are real numbers forming part of an interval of which they can assume any kind of value, an example is the duration of a light bulb or the waiting time.",59.0,stita,0.59,59,435,609,432,430,468,611

-quality when modes are verbal expressions, e.g. sex. can be distinguished between disconnected and ordered: disconnected that there is no order of the modalities, for example the sex cannot be ordered according to a criterion valid for all the male or female modalities, saying that male is better than female; while those ordainable that can be ordered according to a criterion valid for all, for example, the title of studies.

-quantitative when the modes are expressed by numbers and have a unit of measurement. They distinguish between discrete and continuous: discrete ones can take as mode only of whole numbers, for example number of members of a family; continuous ones can assume all the real numbers included in a given range, for example the height.

Unconnected qualitative characters are also called non-metric scales, and are distinguished in orderable and nominal, while quantitative characters are also called metric scales and are distinguished between ratio scales when they have absolute zero, so when zero indicates absence, or interval scale that is used when there is no absolute zero but a relative zero, then zero does not indicate the absence of a characteristic but only from where you start to count.

When it comes to probability we can also refer to different interpretations: the classical definition where the probability of occurrence of the event is equal to the ratio of the number of favorable cases to the number of possible cases admitted that they are equally likely (an example may be the launch of a balanced currency where you want it to test the number of favorable cases is 1 while the number of possible cases is two when the probability of occurrence of the event would be 1/2 or for example in the launch of two dice where you year 36 possible combinations and you want the sum of the two dice equal to six in this case the probability will be given by 5/36 as 5 are the favorable cases and 36 possible ones. the second definition is that frequentist dova the probability of the occurrence of the event is the limit of the frequency relative to the occurrence of the event in a succession of independent tests carried out under the same conditions (for example and you want to calculate the fact that it will dedicate in a given year and it is known that in the last 30 years it has snowed 18 times the probability that it will dedicate in that year is equal to 18/30); finally the third interpretation is given by the objectiveist definition; here the probability is the degree of confidence that an individual, according to his own knowledge, assigns to the occurrence of the event. an example may be be bets; that is how much an individual is willing to pay to get Y in case of winning and nothing in case of loss.

To be defined as such, it must respect axioms which are the axiom of certainty, positivity and additives.

The axiom of certainty means the occurrence of the event in a certain way.

The axiom of positivity means that the probability is always equal to or greater than zero.

By axiom of the additive it is intended that the probability of combining two events is given by the sum of the probability of the first event with the probability of the second event. 

Given the axiomatic definition, there are then three keys to interpretation of probability: classical or objective interpretation, frequentist and objectiveist.

Classical probability is such when the basis of probability calculation itself is the equiprobable, i.e. elementary events are equally likely to occur. For example, if you want to calculate the 'turnout of the three' event by throwing a non-six-faced die, the classic probability of the exit of the desired number is one-sixth.

Frequent probability comes into play when you are not sure of the equivalent, so you have to do a number of tests that tend to infinity, marking the success frequency of the desired event. If, for example, you want to calculate the probability of going out head in an unbalanced currency, you will have to make a high number of throws and count the success of the 'head' event. 

Subjective probability is used when it is not possible to have certain data on the success of an event. The calculation of the objectiveist, given the definition of De Finetti, takes place by degrees of belief of a rational individual who is based on the experience and study of the success of the event. An optimal example is the bets, on which you can go to calculate the degree of belief. If you want to make a bet where you put four and you win how much you are given plus one, you will calculate the probability by dividing the amount given by the sum given plus the win.",80.0,stita,0.8,80,788,1019,792,802,844,1020

-Classical interpretation: the probability of an event is the relationship between the number of cases favorable to this event and the number of possible cases. However, they must be equally likely. For example, the extraction of a certain card.

- Frequentist interpretation: the probability of the event is equal to the limit of the relative frequency with which the event occurs in many repeated tests, all under the same conditions. For example, the launch of a coin.

The probability is an overall function defined in the S sample space, which has the following properties:

- P(S)=1 (axiom certainty);

- P(A)>=0. per A (axiom of positivity);

- P(A1 U A2 U... ) = p(A1)+P(A2)+... for each succession of two-to-two events incompatible (passion of the additive)

This interpretation results in three other classes that apply to different situations:

- Classical (objective) interpretation: the probability of an event A is the ratio between the number of cases favorable to the occurrence of A and the total number of possible cases, assuming that these are equally likely (all elementary events have the same probability). It generally applies where there are mathematical criteria below to calculate this probability. We can take the example with a balanced coin, I have the same probability for both sides of the 1/2 coin.

- Frequentist interpretation (static): The P(A) probability of event A is the limit of the relative frequency with which A occurs in a long series of tests considered under the same conditions. To check if my coin is balanced or not, I'm going to do a series of repeated tests under the same conditions. I register a 48-fold frequency of head on a series of 100 tests: my relative frequency will be 0.48 approximate to the probability of head occurring. The probability is given by the relative frequency.

- Objectiveist interpretation: the probability of an event is the degree of confidence that an individual, on the basis of knowledge possessed at a given time, assigns the occurrence of the event. It is therefore based on the degree of confidence of the rational subject who, according to his knowledge, defines the degree of probability of an event occurring.

FREQUENTIST DEFINITIONS: The probability(A) of an event A is the limit of the relative frequency with which A occurs in a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions. EXAMPLE: clinical trials 

-FREQUENTISM INTO: the probabilities are relative frequencies of success in the tests

-IPOTETIC FREQUENTISM: the probabilities are relative frequencies of success on an infinite hypothetical sequence of tests.

The limits are: the tests must be carried out under the same conditions, in the finite or empirical frequent it may happen that the number of tests is very limited.

The probability of an event is the degree of confidence that an individual, on the basis of knowledge held at a given time, assigns to the occurrence of the event. For the subjective probability we can think of bets. The actors are: the better and the counter. In order for the bet to be fair, it is necessary that it is possible to reverse the roles randomly with 0.5 probability, this prevents the player who plays the role of the better, underestimates the probability of the event or that the dealer overestimates it.

For classical interpretation, the probability of an event A is the ratio of the number of cases favorable to the occurrence of A to the total number of possible cases.     P(A)=n(A)/N.  An example could be the extraction of an ace from a deck of 52 cards, the probability of which is equal to 4/52.

According to the frequentist interpretation, the probability of an event A is the limit of the relative frequency with which A occurs in a series of tests carried out all under the same conditions.           P(A) n-->infinity= n(A)/N.      An example could be the launch of a die 100 times with number 5 output. In this case, the relative frequency at which the event occurs must be calculated 5.

According to the objectiveist interpretation, the probability of an event A is the degree of confidence that a rational and coherent individual, based on the information he possesses, assigns to the occurrence of A. We could think of bets: the objectiveist probability is the price p that a person is willing to pay, to receive 1 if it occurs and 0 if it does not occur.

The axiom of certainty P(S)=1 indicates that the probability of sample space is 1, so certain event. In fact, adding up the probability of all possible events, you get 1 then you reconstruct the sample space (S).
The axiom of positivity P(A)>=0 indicates that an event to be possible must necessarily be greater than 0, otherwise the event is impossible in fact the matching set is empty.
Finally, the axiom of the additive indicates that the probability of intersection of two incompatible events is given by the sum of the probabilities of both events.
The classic probability can only be calculated if the events in question are comparable (e.g. in the launch of a 6-faced unmade die). In this case P(A) is the ratio between the number of times the event A n(A) can be presented and the number of possible events N.
The frequentist probability is only applicable if an experiment repeats itself several times under the same conditions (e.g. launch of a 100-fold balanced currency). So P(A) is given by the limit that tends to infinity for the ratio between the number of times in which event A n(A) is repeated the number of possible events N.
Finally, the objectiveist probability is given by the degree of confidence that is placed in a rational subject which according to data gives the probability to a given event. (e.g. bets where the probability of x win is given by the ratio between how much you bet (x) and the sum of how much you bet plus net win (y). ",80.0,stita,0.8,80,738,947,750,732,788,949

equally likely.

If in fact we know that the athlete has trained very much and is particularly strong, then attribute a high probability value to his winnings.","The probability is the overall function defined in the S sample space, where the set is the domain of the elementary events of the experiment considered. Regarding probability we can consider three types of interpretations:

	* Classical or objective interpretation explains that the probability of an event A is the ratio of the number of cases favorable to the occurrence of A to the total number of possible cases admitted that these are equally likely, in other words all events must have the same probability of occurrence. EXAMPLE: Suppose we have a nut throw. The total number of possible cases in the launch of a die are the elementary events that can occur when you launch a die, that is the number of the sample space that is 6. If I look for the chance of face 3 coming out, I have 6 possible cases and a favorable case that would be face 3. In classical interpretation, the probability of each face, in the case of the die, must be the same.
	* Frequentist or statistical interpretation explains that the P(A) probability of event A is the limit of the relative frequency with which A occurs in a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions. However, it is not always possible to carry out a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions. To calculate the relative frequency, you must have an absolute frequency and a total frequency. EXAMPLE: suppose we have a coin and we know that 50% (fi 0.5) will come out head and 50% will come out cross. We check, however, that the coin is balanced by throwing 100 times the coin and record how many times the head occurs and how many times the cross. This is the performance of repeated tests under the same conditions. 
	* Objectivist interpretation explains that the probability of an event is the degree of confidence that an individual, on the basis of knowledge possessed at a given time, assigns to the occurrence of the event. EXAMPLE: For the subjective probability, think of the bets. The maximum bet X that you are willing to wager to receive a Y amount if the event A occurs and nothing if it does not occur is proportional to what you believe the event can happen and to the amount that you can win.",80.0,stita,0.8,80,809,1055,817,821,869,1058

CLASSIC INTERPRETATION: the probability of an event is the ratio between the number of cases favorable to the occurrence of the event and the number of possible cases, as long as they are all equally possible (e.g. The probability of getting 2 in the launch of a perfect data is 1/6, because there are 6 possible events and of these 1 only is favorable. while getting 8 is 0 because no event is favorable)

FREQUENTIST INTERPRETATION: the probability of an event is the limit of the relative frequency with which that event occurs in a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions.

The random experiment is any act or process whose single execution results in an unpredictable result. single execution because the experiment must be repeatable and the possible outcomes must be possible to be defined in advance. The result of the random experiment is called an elementary event. The set of elementary events is the sample space. probability is an overall function defined in the sample space that enjoys the properties: 

P(S)=1(axiom of certainty)

P(A)=0 (axiom of positivity)

i.e. probability is always between 1=certain event and 0=impossible event

P(A1uA2)=P(A1)+P(A2) for each succession of two to two compatible events, i.e. if I have two events that cannot occurisnieme probability of union is = to the probability of event A1 + A2. 

from here we draw the rule of the complementary event P(non A)=1-P(A)

Interpretations are Classic: the probability of an event A is the ratio between the number of cases favorable to the occurrence of A and the number of the total possible cases if these are equally likely. If you throw a dice the total number of possible throws is = to the number of sample space, i.e. I want to bet that face 3 comes out I have 1/6 chances of winning. Of course the die must not be rigged and the coin balanced. P(A) = n (A)/N other examples extracting a king into a deck of 52 cards.

The frequentist interpretation P(A) of the random event is the relative frequency limit with which it occurs in a series of repeated tests under the same conditions. If I throw the coin 100 times and it comes out head 40 times this will be the frequency limit. I use it in the forensic field to analyze the NA. P(A) Lim->infinity n(A)/N

 Subjective interpretation depends on the degree of trust that each individual has on the basis of knowledge possessed at a time. you can use the bets X,Y P=X/x+1, i.e. the amount you are willing to wager to receive Y if the event occurs and nothing if the event does not occur.

Each random event is represented by the elements of a subset of the event space. In classical interpretation, however, it is stated that when elementary N events are equally likely, i.e. pi=1/N the probability of event A is P(A)=lim (N tending to infinity) n(A)/N. The frequentist probability states that given N tests carried out under the same conditions, the probability of event A is P(A)=lim(N tending to infinity) n(A)/N.

Thanks to the axiomatic definition of probability, three different interpretations of probability can be made: 

	* Classical interpretation: this interpretation is also called 'objective definition'. According to this interpretation the probability of an event A is the ratio between the number of cases favorable to the occurrence of A and the number of possible cases. Classical interpretation can be applied to games of chance, such as poker, eight.  An example may be that of throwing a die;
	* Frequentist interpretation: this interpretation is also called'statistical definition'. According to this interpretation, the probability of an event is the limit of the relative frequency with which event A occurs in a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions. Frequentist interpretation is widely applied in the field of statistics and forensics. For example, if you want to see the probability of a given NA profile being detected in the population you will have to analyze the NA of many people and on these repeated tests you will have to see how many people have that specific NA frequency.
	* objectiveist interpretation: this interpretation is based on the degree of trust of the subject. According to this interpretation the probability of an event is the degree of trust that an individual, on the basis of the knowledge he possesses, assigns to the occurrence of the event.

Axiom of certainty: P(S)=1 which says that the probability of sample space is 1 (sure measure, is the certain event), means that the probability of one of the possible results (elementary events), is a certain event, for example if I throw a coin with sample space (head, cross) is certain that it will come out either head or cross.

Axiom of positivity: it says that for every A, the probability of any event is greater than or equal to 0, so by joining the first axiom to the second we can say that the probability is between 0 (event impossible) and 1 (event certain).

Axiom of additives: it says that you can add up the odds for each succession of two-to-two incompatible events.

From this definition of probability three different interpretations of probability were born:

-Classical interpretation (objective): which says that the probability of an event A is given by the ratio of the number of favorable cases to the number of possible total cases, which must be equally probable, for example if I have a deck of cards of which I consider only the 7 (i.e. four 7, each for a different suit) that composes my sample space, the probability that by fishing one of the 4 cards I fish the 7 of hearts is calculated as the ratio between the favorable cases (i.e. 1) and the possible total cases (i.e. 4).

-The frequentist interpretation: says that the probability of the event a is equivalent to the limit of the relative frequency with which A occurs in a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions. It is then calculated as the ratio of absolute frequency to the total of repeated tests.

-Objectist interpretation says that the probability of event A corresponds to the degree of confidence that the individual, on the basis of knowledge determined in that context, gives to the occurrence of that event; for example in bets is the price that I am willing to pay to receive one at the occurrence of the event or 0 if this does not occur. ",80.0,stita,0.8,80,821,1055,842,829,865,1057

The probability is a function of the whole, in fact it applies to the individual results of the random experiment. The probability has the following axioms:

-of certainty: the prob. of the sample space is equal to 1 because it is certain that an elementary event of the sample space occurs;

-of positivity: the prob. of the event is always greater than or equal to 0 because the prob. is a number between 0 (event impossible) and 1 (event certain);

- additiveity: the probability of union of events is equal to the sum of probs. of events, for each succession of events to 2 to 2 incompatible. 

INTERPRETAZ. CLASSIC or CLEANING: the prob. of an event A is the relationship between the number of cases favorable to its occurrence and the total number of possible cases which must be equally probable; it applies mainly to gambling or in the case of the launch of balanced dice or coins: the prob. the output of an equal number of a die is P(3)=3/6=1/2

INTERPRETAZ. FREQUENTIST OR STATISTICS: the prob. of event A is the limit of the relative frequency with which A occurs in a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions; if you want to see how many times the head occurs by throwing 50 times a coin, the freq is calculated. If head occurs 25 times, f=25/50=0.5 then P(T) is the limit of 0.5. The more evidence I get, the closer I get to the real chance.

INTERPRETAZ. SUBJECTIVE: the prob. of an event is the degree of trust that an individual, based on his knowledge at a given time, assigns to the occurrence of the event; an example are the bets: the prob. Sogg. of an event A is the p price that a person considers fair to pay to receive 1 if the event occurs, 0 if the event does not occur.

It can be expressed as an overall function P(.) defined in sample space S. The probability range ranges from 0 to 1: 0 is the event impossible, 1 the event certain.
A measure, to be defined as probability, must comply with the following axioms:
> the axiom of certainty, P(S)=1 or the set of elementary events forms the certain event;
> the axiom of positivity, P(A)>=0. i.e. probability is always positive;
> the axiom of additiveity: if I subdivide a set into disjoined subsets, the probability will be given by the sum of the probabilities of individual events, P(AE) = P(A) +P(E).
There are several interpretations of probability.
The classical interpretation presupposes that all elementary events have the same probability of occurrence: the probability of an event is given by the events favorable to the occurrence of that event related to the total of elementary events. For example, if you throw a six-faced die, each face has a 1/6 chance to show up. If instead the event consists of ""an even number,"" then the probability will be given by the sum of the probability of the elementary events favorable to the event, then P(A)=3/6, i.e. 1/2. This is an objective probability.
Frequentist interpretation applies when the principle of equal distribution of probability fails: the frequentist probability is the relative frequency limit on N independent tests carried out under the same experimental conditions. If, for example, I suspect that a die is rigged, because maybe it is composed of non-homogeneous material, I will not be able to apply a classic probability for the exit of the number 1. I will then have to repeat the experiment a large number of times, count the times in which the number 1 comes out and report this amount to the total number of tests carried out. This probability is called statistical probability and is applied in forensic sciences as well as in all sciences using statistical methods.
Finally, the objectiveist interpretation consists of the degree of confidence that each individual places in the occurrence of an event. An example of this is betting, governed by a subjective probability. Subjective probability can be described as the price that each individual is willing to pay to receive 1 if the event occurs and 0 if it does not occur.",91.0,stita,0.91,91,880,1130,886,876,932,1133

2) POSITIVENESS AXIOM (in formula P(A)>=0. per A): for each event A the probability of this event occurring is greater than or equal to zero

3) ADDITIVITY AXIOM' the combination of two-to-two incompatible events is equal to the sum of the odds of the two individual events.

It tells us that probability is an overall function, which we indicate with P, defined in the S sample space, which enjoys the following properties:

AXIOM OF SERIOUSNESS, which tells us that the probability of S (the probability of sample space) is equal to 1

AXIOM OF POSITIVENESS, which tells us that the probability of any event is greater than or equal to 0 (probability 0 corresponds to the event impossible and probability 1 corresponds to the event certain)

AXIOM OF ADDITIVENESS, which tells us that if we have two incompatible events (i.e. that they cannot occur together) the probability of union is the sum of the odds.

According to the classical interpretation the probability of an ""A"" event is the ratio between the number of cases favorable to the occurrence of ""A"" and the total number of possible cases, assuming that these are equally likely (meaning that all elementary events must have the same probability of occurrence)

Es. ""the throwing of a die"": the total number of possible cases is given by the number of S that in this case is 6 (i.e. the 6 sides of the die) and if for example I bet on the exit of the number three, the favorable case will be 1 (which is the face 3): so I will have a chance of 1/6 winning.

If instead I bet on the output of an even number (2.4.6) the favorable cases will be 3 and the number of possible cases will always be 6: eagle chances will be 3/6 of winning.

According to the frequentist interpretation the probability of an event is the limit of the relative frequency with which that event occurs in a long series of repeated tests under the same conditions.

e.g."" launch of a coin"": suppose to throw 100 times a coin and to record how many times Head comes out and how many times Cross comes out. 

Suppose T came out 48 times and the number of tests is 100, we'll say that 48/100=0.48 and I'll say that 0.48 approximates the probability of head occurring.

The best measure of uncertainty is the probability expressed by values included in a scale ranging from 0 to 1. The evaluation of it depends on 2 factors, the first is the event that you want to calculate the probability, the second is the information available (I). The result of this assessment is the probability that it is necessary given the known.

The frequentist probability instead is found in the case in which wanting to verify the probability of the appearance of a given event, for example the side of the cross face in a coin, we do not know whether that coin is rigged or not, therefore the frequentist probability explains that the determination of a given event like that of the cross face will be equal to the limit of the relative frequency given by the number of times that event occurred in the n tests all under the same conditions, for example if having carried out an experiment dictated by 100 tests of the launch and the cross face has presented 48 times, we will have to calculate the limit of 0,48.

We must first calculate the number n of all possible cases. Since each nut can fall on each of its 6 faces and there are 2 dice, the total will be n= 6*6= 36.

It follows that the probability relative to the first event will be P(A1)=3/36= 1/12. Now let's calculate the number n(A2) favor cases related to the second event. We observe that being the 12 the maximum number that can be obtained by throwing two dice, say that

If Luca accepts the bet, there are two possible results: 1. Carlo's team wins. If Carlo has estimated 1/4 the probability of victory, he is willing to pay 1 figurine to cash 4 in case of victory, then if he has wagered 5 figurines, to determine the number of figurines he will collect just make the preposition 1:4=5:x from which (5*4)/1= 20 figurines.

-axiom of positivity: P(A)>=0

-Axiom of additives: P(A U B U...)=P(A)+P(B)+...

Example: In one urn there are 5 white marbles, 3 red marbles and 2 blue marbles. The probability of distracting a blue marble is P(LU)=1/5.

Frequentist Interpretation:The probability of an event occurring is given by the limit of the sum of the relative frequencies obtained by repeating the experiment several times always under the same conditions.

Example: Knowing that on 100 launches of a balanced coin, 50 results report head and 50 cross, calculate the chances that the next launch will come out head. P(T)=0.5

The classical interpretation states that the probability is given by the relationship between the number of cases favorable to the event and the number of possible cases, provided that the latter are equally possible; an example of this type of interpretation may be an experiment in the launch of the die in which the probability that throwing an unmade die out an even number is 3/6.

The frequentist interpretation defines the probability of an event as the limit to which the relative frequency of the event tends to increase in the number of experiments, so to be able to know the probability of an event you have to resort to experience, in the sense that on a high number of tests, you find a certain regularity. This is also possible when elementary events are not all considered possible to an equal extent but the experiment is supposed to be repeatable several times, such as in the launch of a coin; in this case the empirical law of the case is valid, in which there is a series of repeated tests and performed all under the same conditions and every possible event occurs with a frequency equal to its probability. The objectiveist approach of probability indicates the probability of an event and the trustworthy measure that a coherent individual attributes to the occurrence of the event; therefore the probability of the same event may also be different if given by different subjects. You can talk about the sum that an individual is willing to pay to receive a euro in case of winning. For example, if you attribute the probability of 0.6 to a given event, it means that you are willing to pay the price of 60 cents to receive 1 euro in case the event occurs. ",70.0,stita,0.7,70,740,970,744,738,783,972

2. to formulate the question in statistical terms: to identify the statistics that can solve the problem;

2) to formulate the demand in statistical terms

These need to be verified, accepted or rejected. 

First of all, we need to identify the problem and ask ourselves what we want to look at. Once that has been done, the question will be asked in statistical terms in such a way as to understand what type of statistics should be used. It is then necessary to put a first hypothesis, said nothing and following this, an alternative hypothesis.

1) to identify the problem and to formulate the question that you want to verify, on which then I have to build the statistical test. We compare two average samples or one sample with one of the population, or we compare two proportions. We must ask ourselves whether these values we compare are equal or different.

2) Form the question in statistical terms.

3) Define the hypothesis nothing: it is the hypothesis that you have no interest in, in general you assume equality. Therefore, the hypothesis nothing goes to affirm the equality between the two proportions or the two averages.

4) We define the alternative hypothesis. On the other hand, it affirms a relationship of inequality or of minor or greater.

5) Select the random sample. I need to see if the empirical evidence supports my hypothesis or not nothing.

6) The test statistics which can be calculated from the sample data and is a sample statistics shall be calculated. It, for any parameter, is found by making the statistics of interest (the summary of the sample observations) minus the figure assumed for the parameter all divided by the standard error of the statistics that interests us. The numerator tells us the difference between what I observe and what I hypothesize, that is the distance of statistics from what I hypothesized and on the basis of this I have to make a decision.

7) It is decided whether or not to refuse the hypothesis nothing according to two alternative methods: by comparing the value of the test statistic with a certain threshold or by calculating the p-value (the smaller this value is and the more distant we are from the null hypothesis). The p-value gives us the probability of observing a value of the test statistic equal to or greater than the value obtained by the sample, under the zero hypothesis. Less is the level of significance observed and the more I distance myself from what I have hypothesized. Assuming nothing, it is refused for p-value levels of less than 1%, 5% and 10%.

In the face of a hypothesis nothing must always be defined a second hypothesis, an alternative hypothesis: in general a hypothesis nothing is what is considered true until proven otherwise. The hypotheses are simple if they express only a value of the parameter, bidirectional because they include both greater values and those less than 5. In other cases you will have a composite one-way hypothesis. We will then formalize the two hypotheses. The test is a rule by which it is decided to accept or reject the hypothesis nothing on the basis of the empirical evidence provided by the observed sample data. We must then calculate the average sample and, in order to make a decision on the hypothesis to be formulated, we must see if it falls within the acceptance zone or in the rejection zone: if it falls within the waste area then we can say that the empirical evidence is in favor of the hypothesis nothing because these values are very likely. The extremes that form the boundary between the acceptance zone and the rejection zone are called critical values.

The hypothesis under verification is called zero H0 hypothesis; the opposite conjecture is called alternative H1 hypothesis. The hypothesis nothing is the hypothesis that you have no interest in. If you are interested in the difference between two proportions or between two averages, the hypothesis will not assert a relationship of inequality or greater or lesser. It is possible to make assumptions about the average or the proportion or to make comparisons between averages and comparisons between proportions. In order to test the hypothesis, the creation of a random sample must be analysed. Test statistics are statistics calculated from sample data and are sample statistics. To highlight the test result it is possible to calculate the p-value, i.e. the probability of observing a statistical test value equal to or greater than the value obtained by the sample, under the zero hypothesis. Measure the evidence provided by the data against the null hypothesis; the lower the value of the p.value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis. If p-value<alpha refuses the null hypothesis.    LFA is the level of significance of the test. The p-value is also called observed level of significance.

At first I have a real problem and starting from this problem I ask the question on which then I have to build the statistical test.

This question must then be translated into statistical terms.

Later the hypothesis system is defined: nothing H0 hypothesis which is the one that I submit to verification and which is generally expressed as simple hypothesis (e.g. the suspect is innocent) and the alternative hypothesis H1 which is the opposite hypothesis to that nothing (e.g. the suspect is guilty) and generally expressed as a compound hypothesis.

Once you have defined the hypothesis system (H0 and H1) you have to select a random sample because I have to collect empirical evidence, because I have to see if empirical evidence supports my hypothesis or not nothing.

From the random sample data the test statistics are then calculated: i.e. the sample statistics are calculated from the sample data.

Then the p-value (compared to the test statistics) must be calculated: it is a probability and I measure, in a certain sense, the distance of what I observe from what I hypothesized (me the measure in the sense that the smaller this value, the greater the distance)

6-calculate the test statistic: it must have a good synthesis value for the characteristic of the phenomenon of interest and its distribution must be known for the hypothesis nothing.

7-calculus of the p-value: the p-value serves to see if there are statistical test values equal to or more extreme than those of the random sample of the null hypothesis. It serves to demonstrate the evidence against the hypothesis nothing and the lower this value is, the greater the evidence against the hypothesis nothing.

8-decide whether to reject the null hypothesis: when the obtained value falls within the rejection zone or the p-value has a lower level of significance than the meaningfulness index of the chosen test (can be <0.01, <0.05 or <0.1) then the null hypothesis is rejected. ",70.0,stita,0.7,70,660,938,672,704,696,940

It must be determined what the hypothesis is nothing and what are the alternative hypotheses. The statistical test should then be followed. Then we will calculate the sample distribution of the test with which we can know the possibility of a certain result if all the requirements of the test are met. It then fixes the H0 hypothesis waste area and is the significant level. The smaller this smaller area will be the risk that you run in rejecting H0. The level of significance of the test is linked to the waste area, so the level determines an area where the results are unlikely and difficult to find in reality if it were true H0. Once the level of significance has been established and the type of K test is calculated, the KA critical point of the test shall be calculated in relation to the chosen level. It will be decided in order to reject H0 when, the value of the KA empirical test falls into the rejection zone of the H0 hypothesis. In the hypothesis verification we find the errors of dozens, which can be of first type (or error of the first species) where the probability of making an error is given by the level of significant to chosen. It is the fraction of times that a null and void hypothesis is rejected if the test on several samples is repeated so many times. We then have the second type error where the chances of making an error is generally indicated with the Beta symbol. The additional Beta probability, i.e. the probability of rejecting a false hypothesis correctly, is called the power of the test. The greater the power of a test, the greater the possibility of the test to identify that hypothesis as correct.

H0: μ = 11

H1: μ > 11

The hypothesis checked goes under the name of zero H0 hypothesis. The opposite statement is called alternative H1 hypothesis. 

There are several steps regarding the verification of assumptions.

The first concerns the identification of the problem and the formulation of the question that you want to verify, The second formulas the question in statistical terms or the identification of the statistics that can solve the problem and the third the proposing the hypothesis nothing, that is the hypothesis for which you are not interested, is usually hypothesized the equality or the absence of an effect and we are interested in the difference between two propositions for which then the hypothesis nothing affirms their equality. With regard to step four, the alternative hypothesis must be proposed, if one is interested in the difference between two proportions or between two averages, the alternative hypothesis will affirm a relationship of inequality of greater or lesser. The fifth step concerns the cutting of the random sample, the report of a random sample must be analysed in order to test the hypothesis. In the sixth step, you have to calculate the test statistic, which is a statistic that can be calculated from the sample data. The statistical test is a sample statistics which in general must provide a new synthesis of the characteristic of the phenomenon concerned and must ensure that its distribution is known assuming as true the hypothesis nothing. The seventh step concerns the rule of decision that can take place in two ways: either by comparing the value of the test statistic with the theoretical values that separate the acceptance zone from that of refusal, or by calculating the p-value and comparing it with the theoretical values. The last step, i.e. the eighth step, is to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis; in fact, when the test statistic falls into the rejection zone or when the p-value is lower than the nominal level of significance, it is said that the test is significant and rejects the null hypothesis. ",80.0,stita,0.8,80,800,1125,799,820,848,1127

Prepositions have three fundamental principles: that of bivalence (a preposition can take only two values, either the true one or the false one), that of non contradiction (a proposition can never assume the true or false value at the same time) and that of the excluded third (a preposition must have by force either a criterion or the other, must never be deprived of it).

 Operations can be made on the prepositions using logical connectors, which result in other prepositions of which the value of truth must be studied and the so-called tables of truth are used to do so.  the operations are 5:

1) NATION: it is an uniary operation where precisely I have only one preposition p and I must find its negation, called ""non p"": when p is false, ""NON P"" is true and vice versa. EXAMPLE - p: SNOW IS WHITE (V) NOT P: SNOW IS NOT WHITE (F). The logical connectors to use are ""is"" and ""is not""

2) DISCIUNTION OR MMA OICA: I have two prepositions p and q, the new preposition that derives from this operation is ""P O Q"" which is false when p and q of departure are both false, otherwise it is true. EXAMPLE - p: PO' IS A ARE (F) q: ITALY IS A CONTINENT (F) p o q: PO' IS A ARE OR ITALY IS A CONTINENT (F).  The logical connective factor to use is ""o'

3) CONJUNTION OR PRODUCT LOGO: I have two prepositions p and q, the new preposition that derives from this operation is ""P E Q"" which is true when p and q of departure are both true, otherwise it is false.

Bivalent logical propositions must obey two fundamental principles:

- principle of non-contradiction: a proposition cannot be both false and true, the fact that p is true excludes p is false and vice versa. 

- principle of the third party excluded: any proposition can be assigned the true value or false value. A proposition cannot be true or false. 

The possible elementary operations are:

-Negation: Unaria operation because it applies to a single proposition. Given the proposition p, his denial will be a new proposition that will be false only if p is true, and true only if p is false. 

es: the proposition ""the sun is yellow"" has by negation the proposition ""the sun is not yellow,"" the first is true, so the second is false. 

- Dijunction or logical sum: binary operation because it applies to two propositions. There are two propositions. The phrase p or q (pq) is a new proposition that turns out to be false only if they are both false otherwise it is always true.

es: ""Italy is a nation or the Po is a river"" is true because they are both true. ""Italy is a continent or the Po is a river"" is true because q is true. ""Italy is a continent or the Po is a lake"" is false because they are both false. 

-Conjunction or logical product: binary operation because it applies on two propositions. Whether p and q two propositions, the phrase p and q (pΛq) is a new proposition that turns out true when both are true otherwise it is always false. 

es: ""The sun is yellow and the sea is blue"" is true because they are both true. ""The sun is black and the sea is blue"" is false because p is false. 

-Implication: both p and q two propositions. The phrase p → q is a new proposition that turns out to be false only when q is false, otherwise it is always true. The first proposition is called antecedent or hypothesis, the second subsequent or thesis.

es: ""If Milan is a city, then the snow is black"" is false because q is false. ""If Milan is a nation, then snow is white"" is true because q is true. 

- Bi-implication: both p and q two propositions. The phrase p↔q is a new proposition that turns out true only if both have the same value of truth (or both true or both false), otherwise it is false. 

es: ""If and only if Asia is a continent, then grass is green"" is true because they are both true. ""If and only if Asia is a city, then the grass is red"" is true because they are both false. ""If and only if Asia is a continent and the grass is red"" is false because one of them is false (q).

It must be remembered, however, that any proposition must be subject to the two fundamental principles such as that of non-contradiction and that of the excluded third party.

The operations we have seen are mainly five:

1. Denial: it happens when one proposition is true when the other is false and vice versa. 

example: proposition p: ""25 is an even number,"" proposition ""not p"": ""25 is NOT an even number""

2. Disjunction or logical sum: both p and q two propositions, the new proposition ""p or q"" is false when both the starting proportions are false, otherwise it is true. 

example: false proposition p: ""3 is an even number, false proposition"" q: ""3 is a divisible number by 5,"" the new proposition ""p or q"" is false because ""3 is an even number or divisible by 5"".

3. conjunction: be p and q two propositions, the new proposition ""p and q"" is true only if both are true, otherwise it is false.

example: real proposition p: ""Italy is a nation,"" real proposition q ""Po is a river,"" the new proportion ""p and q"" true is ""Italy is a nation and Po is a river.""

to be emphasized that these last two elementary operations enjoy three properties such as that of impotence, commutative and associative.

4. implication: be p and q two propositions, the new proposition ""p implies q"" is false only if p is true and q is false. within this proposition there is a logical dependence that causes ""p"" to be defined hypothesis while ""q"" is defined as thesis or consequence and the whole is expressed through the verbal expression ""if... then.""

example: real proposition p: ""Luca è trentino"", false proposition q ""Luca è non italiano"", new proposition ""p impels q"" ""if Luca is Trentino then Luca is not Italian""

5. Application: be p and q two propositions, the result of the new proposition defined conditional will be true only if p and q both have truth value, otherwise it will be false. This proportion will be expressed through the phrase ""p if and only if q"" where p is sufficient and necessary to q.

example: p: I'm breathing, proportion q: I'm alive, new proposition p involved q: I'm breathing if and only if I'm alive",100.0,stita,1.0,100,1298,1669,1371,1292,1339,1671

In classical logic the principle of bivalentity is assumed: a proposition assumes only one and only one of the values; true (v;1) or false (F;0).
True or false qualities are the truth value of the proposition. A question, an exclamation or an opinion are not propositions.

There are two principles:

-Principle of non-contradiction according to which a proposition cannot be both true and false;

-Principle of the third party excluded that a proposition must always be true or false.

Operations of propositions: negation, disjunction / logical sum, conjunction / logical product, implication and implication.

-Negation: both P a proposition, the negation of P is denoted by P delta not P.

P delta is true if P is false and it is false if P is true. 

The operator ""not"" is called unitary connective because it is applied to a single proposition.

- Dijunction/logical sum: both P and two propositions the phrase ""P or A"" denoted by pa is a new proposition that turns out to be false only when P and A are both false, otherwise true.

-Conjunction/logical product: both P and A two propositions, the phrase ""P and A"" denoted by p/\a is a new proposition that turns out true when P and A are both true, otherwise it is false.

-Implication: both P and A two propositions, the implication ""P then A"" denoted by p->a is a new proposition that turns out to be false when P is true and A is false, otherwise it is true.

- The denial. It is the only single operation that applies to a single proposition, in fact we have the proposition p and we deny it.His denial we define as ""not p"" (¬p).The connective that we use in Italian is ""not."" As for all operations on propositions we have a table of truth in which we find that when p is true ¬p is false, whereas when p is false ¬p is true. For example: Il Po bagna Torino (p è vera), his denial will be Il Po non bagna Torino(¬p is false);

-Disjunction or logical sum. In this case we have two propositions p and q that are joined by the connective ""or."" We will have from this union a new proposition ""p or q"" (pq) that will always be true except when both p and q are false. For example: Italy is a continent (p and it is false), The Po is a lake (q and it is false); Italy is a continent or the Po is a lake (pq is false);

- the logical conjunction or product. Here too we have two propositions p and q joined this time by the logical connective ""e."" The new proposition will be ""p and q""(p^q) which is always false except when both p and q are true. For example: Il Po bagna Torino(p è vera), La Senna bagna Parigi (q è vera); Il Po bagna Torino and la Senna bagna Parigi (p^q è vera);

- The implication. In this case we have a proposition p which is an antecedent and q which is a consequence. It is said that ""p implies q"" or ""if p then q""(p->q). The p->q proposition is always true except when p is true and q is false. For example: the footballer if he makes 40 goals (p) then he will win 10 million euros(q), if the footballer were to score 40 goals but will receive nothing what said will be false (p->q is false);

- the implication. We have p and q that imply, and we can say that ""p if and only if q"" (p<->q), the new proposition will only be true if both p and q are true or false.

2)Conjunction or logical product--> is used the conjunction ""e"" and it is said that: are p and q two propositions, the proposition ""p and q"" will be a new proposition that will be true when p and q are both true and false in other cases.
An example when ""p and q"" is true: ""the Po is a river"" and ""Italia is a nation""--> this proposition will be true
3) Dijunction or logical sum--> is used the disjunctive conjunction ""or"" and it is said that: are p and q two propositions, then the proposition ""p or q"" will be a proposition that will be false when p and q are both false, in other true cases.

4)Implication--> be p and q two propositions, the proposition ""if p then q"" is a new proposition that will be false only when p is true and q is false, in other cases it is true. p is defined as an antecedent or hypothesis, q is defined as a result or thesis.
An example of ""if p then q"" fake: let's take as an example the clause of a soccer player's contract, which states ""that if the player scores more than 40 goals in the championship, then he will receive a bonus of 1 million euros,"" this clause will be violated only if the player scores more than 40 goals but doesn't receive the bonus, for other cases it doesn't tell us anything.
5)Implication--> be p and q two propositions, the proposition ""p if and only if q"" is a new proposition that will be true only when p and q have equal truth value, i.e. when p and q are both true or both false.

The operations on propositions are: negation, disjunction or logical sum, logical conjunction or product, implication and implication.

Denial: both a proposition and its denial is given by non. This means that if p is true then it is not false and vice versa.

Destruction: both p and q two propositions, the disjunction is indicated with the symbol ""V,"" then pq (p or q). The disjunction pq is false if they are both false, otherwise it is true.

Conjunction: both p and q two propositions, the conjunction is indicated with the symbol ""^,"" then p^q (p and q). The conjunction is true only if they are both true, otherwise it is false.

Application: be p and q two propositions, the implication is indicated p -->q (p implies q), this means that the implication is false if q is false because q is necessary for p.

Application: be p and q two propositions, the implication is indicated with p<->q, this means that the implication is true only if they are both true.

Example of denial: Rome is the capital of Italy is true. His denial ""Rome is not the capital of Italy"" is false.

Example disjunction: The snow is white or Abruzzo is a state. It's true because the first one is true.

Conjunction: The snow is white and Abruzzo is a region. It's true because both are true.

Application: If the snow is white then the Po is a river. It's true because the second is true.

Application: If and only if the Po is a river, Abruzzo is a region. It's true because both are true.",100.0,stita,1.0,100,1175,1483,1227,1168,1217,1485
,"A proposition is defined as a statement to which, by means of an objective criterion, the true or false value can be made to correspond; this quality is called the truth value of the proposition, whose main task is to study what is the logical consequence link between the propositions.
Logical propositions must respect two fundamental principles: the principle of non-contradiction according to which a proposition cannot simultaneously have true and false quality (it cannot be true and false at the same time) and the principle of the third excluded according to which a logical proposition cannot have either true or false quality (it cannot be true or false).
Elementary operations with propositions are:
1.denial: in which the operator ""does not"" is called unitary connective as it refers to only one proposition. Given a proposition p, its denial, -p, is true if p is false and false if p is true. In mathematics the double negation of p is equal to p.
e.g. Paris is the capital of France (v); -p: Paris is not the capital of France (f)
2. Disjunction or logical sum: in mathematics the disjunctive conjunction ""or"" translates the inclusive ego. Given two propositions p and q, disjunction p or q, p v q, is a new proposition that turns out to be false if p and q are both false otherwise it is true.
es p: Paris is the capital of France (v); q: the days of the week are nine (f) --> p v q: Paris is the capital of France or the days of the week are nine (v)
3. logical conjunction or product: given two propositions p and q, the conjunction p and q, p^q is true if p and q are both true otherwise it is false.
es p: Paris is the capital of France (v); q: the days of the week are nine (f) --> p^ q: Paris is the capital of France and the days of the week are nine (f)
4. implication (conditional): both p and q two propositions the implication p -->q is a proposition that turns out to be false when p is true and q is false, otherwise it is true. There are several terminologies to indicate the implication es: p implies q, p is sufficient for q, q is necessary for p, if p..then q. (the connective tissue if it is not part of the proposition and if... then it indicates the existence of a logical dependence). p is called precedent or hypothesis, q resulting or thesis.
es p: Paris is the capital of France (v); q: the days of the week are nine (f) --> p --> q: if Paris is the capital of France then the days of the week are nine (f)
5. implication (conditional): both p and q two propositions p<-->q is true if p and q have the same value of truth, otherwise it is false. Equivalent ways of saying are: p if and only if q, p is necessary and sufficient for q, if p then q and vice versa.
e.g. Paris is the capital of France (v); q: the days of the week are nine (f) --> p <--> q: Paris is the capital of France if and only if the days of the week are nine (f)","Proposition is a statement in which through an objective criterion it can assume a value of truth or false value. The proposition is determined by two precipices: the principle of the third excluded where the population cannot have neither true quality and nor false quality; and the principle of non contradiction where the proposition can assume only true quality or only false quality. 

As for the operations are part of it: -THE NATION: where you give two prepositions p and p (with the hyphen above) these are true if p is true and p (with the hyphen false), otherwise pep are false. Moreover the negation is defined as unitary connective as only one proposition assumes negative value. ES: p:""Roma is the capital of Italy""=V p(with the hyphen):""Roma is not the capital of Italy""

-DISJUNTION: given two propositions p and q these are detonating from the symbol V then you will have:pq.L ""or"" INCLUSIVE you have when both prepositions are ALE, otherwise we talk about ""or"" EXCLUSIVE.

ES: p:""Snow is green""=F q:""The sea is purple""=F.

-CONJUNTION: the conjunction of two propositions p and q is detonated by the symbol ""^"" then you will have p^q. This is ERA when both are true otherwise it is false. ES: ""Bari is the capital of Puglia""=V ""Dalì was an artist""=V.

-IMPLICATION: p->q, implication you have when p is FASA and q is ERA. ES:""The trees are black""=F q:""The sky is blue""

-BICONDITIONAL: p<->q, this operation assumes true value when both propositions have the same truth value. ES:p:""Paris is the capital of France""=V q:""France is part of the EU""=V",40.0,stita,0.4,40,1136,1406,1197,1131,1191,1408

The operations we can carry out with the Propositions are 5:
1) Denial: Having a proposition and adding the OT/NON connective we can change the value from TRUE to FALSE and vice versa. (Ex. Rome is located in Italy (V) --> Rome is NOT in Italy (F)
2) Logic Sum: Having two propositions we will have through the logical connective OR/OPPURE/O a true value in case LMNO one of the two is true and FALSE in case both are false. (Ex: Rome is in France (F) OR Paris is in Italy (V) --> The value of the sum of the two propositions is true)
3) Logic Product: Having two propositions we will have through the logical connective AND/E a true value ONLY if ENTRAMBE the propositions are true and FALSE in cases where even only one of the two is false. (Es: Roma is located in Sardinia (F) And Milan is located in Lombardy (V) --> The value of this Logic Product turns out to be FALSE)
4) Application: Having two propositions we will have through the logical Connective SE... THEN a TRUE value in case both statements are ERE or both are ALE and in case THE FIRST that IMPLICA the second is FASA, instead assigns a FALSE value when the second proposition (that involved) is the only one that turns out FASA.
If an assumption B, True or False, is implied by an assumption False A will assume an always true value because it is starting from a surrealistic assumption.
(Ex: IF the cows can fly (F) THEN vitamin C hurts the bones (F) --> Starting if we assume that the cows can fly, which is false, then whatever we say afterwards will always be true or false ERA -Of course Vitamin C doesn't hurt the bones-)
5) Application: Having two propositions we will have through the logical Connective IF... THEN... AND VIEVERSA a TRUE value in case both propositions represent the True and also in case both represent the False (If the cows fly then the clouds would appear in the sky) and a FALSE value in case ONLY NA of the two present a false assumption.

Another principle of preposition is the third excluded that the proposition cannot assume a value other than ""true"" or ""false,"" and yet another is the principle of non-contradiction, according to which a proposition cannot assume true or false value at the same time. The first operation we can do is negation, in this case the negation of the proposition p will be true when p will be false and will be false when p will be true, for example if the proposition po is a river is true, its negation (the po is not a river) will be false. Another operation is the conjunction, where the logical connective ""e"" is used, given a proposition p and q, it will only be true if both are true, for example it will be true if I say the little is a river and the birds fly. Disjunction uses logical connective ""or"" given a proposition p or q, it will be false only when both will be false, it will be false if I say the po is not a river or the birds do not fly. Then we have the implication, where p is an antecedent and q a consequence. In this case, terms such as ""if p, then q"" are used. In this case the proposition will be false if the predecessor p will be true and the consequent q false. For example, if I say that a footballer has a clause that if he scores 30 goals then he will receive economic bonuses, in this case the proposition will be false only if the player scored 30 goals will not receive the bonus. Then we have the bi-implication that uses terms of the type ""p if and only if q"" and in this case the proposition will be true only if both p and q are either true or both false. For example it will be true if I have two propositions of the type the po is a river if and only if the birds fly, or the po is a mountain if and only if the birds live in the sea. ",100.0,stita,1.0,100,1173,1473,1229,1155,1203,1475

For example p= the dog is an animal(V) and q= the man is an animal(V); the new proposition will be: the dog is an animal p the man is an animal.

The conjunction instead or logical product is when p and q (previous and consequent), which build a new proposition when p and q are both true; in all other cases it is false. The logical connective is the is, e.g.:p=the sky is clear(V) and q=the clouds are in the sky(V). The proposition p(as logical connective) and q will be: the sky is serene and the clouds are in heaven.

In the implication or conditional we still find p and q, p which implies q is false if p is true and q is false, otherwise p which implies q is true. For example p=the river is full and q=the water overflows on the shore and then we will have in the new proposition: if the river is full, then the water overflows on the shore.

In the end we find the implication or the conditional in which p and q constitute a new proposition that turns out true only if they both have the same value of truth., otherwise it turns out false.For example p=the river is clean and q=citizens treat it; therefore the new proposition will be: the river is clean if and only if the citizens treat it.

It is defined as bivalent because the claims can certainly be true or definitely false. The logic of propositions is subjected to two principles that are the principle of non-contradiction, which explains that the proposition cannot at the same time be true or false. The second principle is that of the excluded third party, i.e. a proposition must have true quality or false quality. It is possible to perform operations that consist of transforming a proposition or connecting two or more through operators, defined as logical connectors. Operations shall be: 

The negation that treats a single proposition defined as unaria and denies it. An example could be Pescara is an Italian city, indicated with (p), Pescara is not an Italian city, indicated with (not p).

Then there is the transaction disjunction or logical sum that deals with two propositions and will be false only when both will be false and is indicated with p or q. The example could be Rome is the capital of Italy or the Po is a river. It's true as one of them is true. 

On the contrary, the logical conjunction or product states that two propositions will be true only when both appear to be true. So the example Rome is the capital of Italy and the Po is a river, it is false because one of the two is not true. 

Finally, one has the implication that it always consists in two propositions called before and indicated with p, resulting indicated with q and establishes that the proposition is true when the predecessor is true as the p implies q. ",100.0,stita,1.0,100,1069,1367,1114,1057,1107,1369

Another aspect is to determine, given certain premises, other propositions that are their logical consequence.

In classical logic the principle of bivalentity is assumed: a proposition can take only one and only one of the values.

The term proposition indicates a statement to which the true value or false value can be matched.

On the propositions you can perform several operations that take the name of logical connectors and are:

- NATION. Only one proposition (p) is considered in the denial. The negation of p is referred to as ""not p""; it is not true if p is false and is false if p is true.

example: p=Roma is the capital of Italy not p=Roma is not the capital of Italy.

-Dissolution. In disjunction two propositions (p and q) are taken into consideration which are referred to as ""p or q."" Disjunction is false when both are false otherwise it is true.

example: p=Roma is a nation(F) q=The Po is a lake(F) p or q=Roma is a nation or the Po is a lake(F)

-CONUNTION. In conjunction the propositions are joined as ""p and q."" The proposition p and q is true when both are true otherwise it is false.

example: p=Roma is the capital of Italy (V) q=The Po is a river(V) p and q=Roma is the capital of Italy and the Po is a river (V)

- IMPLICATION. In the implication there are two propositions that are called hypotheses and thesis. They are referred to as ""p then q."" If p then q is false when p is true and q is false, otherwise it is true.

example: p=The Po is a river(V) q=Italy is a continent(F) p then q=If the Po is a river then Italy is a continent(F)

- BILMPLICATION. In implication p implies q and q implies p. It is true when p and q are both true or false.

example: p=Italy is a nation(V) q=The Po is a river(V) p implies q=Italy is a nation if and only if the Po is a river(V).",100.0,stita,1.0,100,1174,1454,1235,1177,1219,1456

bi-implication, p<->q turns out true when p and q have the same truth value, otherwise it is false. e.g. p=The Seine bathes Paris V q=Lazio is an Italian region V p<->q=La Seine bathes Paris if and only if Lazio is an Italian region. V",79.0,stita,0.79,79,974,1215,1030,978,1007,1217

1.denial: in which the operator ""does not"" is called unitary connective as it refers to only one proposition. Given a proposition p, its denial, -p, is true if p is false and false if p is true. In mathematics the double negation of p is equal to p.

This logic is based on two principles: the principle of non-contradiction or that a proposition cannot be true or false at the same time; the principle of the excluded third party or that a proposition can be either true or false, there are no other possibilities. Operations related to propositions are defined as elementary or logical connective, on which a table of truth is used. In each one there is the recognition of a connective, or an expression of the language in which a proposition is obtained composed from one or more propositions given. The operations are as follows: 
1) Denial, which works on a single proposition ""p,"" whose denial is ""not p; in this case the connective is ""not""; When p is true, the ""non p"" is false, and vice versa. Example: p->The sun is a star, not p-> the sun is not a star. 

2) Disjunction or logical sum, which works on two propositions ""pvq,"" p or q ""pvq"" is false only when both p and q are false. In this case the connective is ""or""; Example: p-> men have two arms, q-> the sun sets, in this case pvq is true. 

3) Conjunction or logical product, which works on two propositions p^q, p and q; p^q is true only when both p and q are true. in this case the connective tissue is ""e'. Example:p-> banana is a fruit;q->vegetarians eat meat. in this case p^q is false, because p is true but q is false.

 4) Application or conditional, which works on two propositions p->q, if p(thesis) then q (thesis,consequence). It is false only when p is true and q is false. Example p: a student studies to achieve maturity; q: will not fail. From the syntactic point of view there is no need for the implication to be meaningful. 5) Bi-implication, which also works on two propositions p<->q, p if and only if q; it is true only if both p and q are both true or both false.

operations on propositions may be: negation; disjunction; conjunction; implication;implication.

1.The negation is an operation defined as unaria because it works on a single proposition.

is p a proposition, the negation of p is denoted by -p.

the form proposition -p is true if p is false, and it is false when p is true.

given the proposition ""Roma is the capital of Italy"" its denial will be: ""Roma is not the capital of Italy""

2. In disjunction or logical sum:

are p and q two propositions, the phrase ""p or q"" is called by pq, it is a new proposition that turns out to be false when p and q are both false. 

example: given two propositions p ""Po is a sea"" and q ""Italy is a continent"" then pq will be ""Po is a sea or Italy is a continent""

3.in conjunction or logical product:

are p and q two propositions, the phrase p and q is called p^q. the proposition turns out true when p and q are both true otherwise it is false

example: given two propositions p""The Po is a river(Vera)"" and q""Italy is a nation(true)"" then p^q ""Italy is a nation and the po is a river"" true.

4.In the implication, give two propositions p and q, where p is said to be prior hypothesis and the second subsequent or thesis.

the p->q implication is false when p is true. It says ""p implies q""

example given two propositions p""milano is a city"" and q ""snow is black"" then p->q is ""Milan is a city then snow is black.",100.0,stita,1.0,100,1119,1403,1180,1126,1153,1405

Despite this, the jury issued a guilty verdict mainly on the basis of the prosecution's attorney's testimony that only 1 out of 3 million (MP: random match probability) of people had a NA profile corresponding to that found, so the probability that Brown was innocent was equal to 1 out of 3 million.
In the appeal process, the defense attorney argued that the conclusions drawn on the basis of the statistics quoted by the prosecution's attorney were incorrect and were an example of the accuser's fallacy.
The Supreme Court in justifying the decision explained this fallacy by stating that the error of the pm is given by the hypothesis that the MP is the same probability that the defendant was not the source of the NA sample. The mistake is that the probability of such correspondence, given the evidence, is also the probability that the NA sample at the crime scene comes from someone other than Brown. If it is true that the accused was innocent, then there would be a probability in 3 million of a correspondence of NA and MP does not refer to the final hypothesis that the accused was innocent or guilty, but only at the origin of the trace of NA.

When NA is found at the crime scene, the accuser's fallacy consists in exchanging the probability that the NA belongs to a particular subject, with the probability that that subject is guilty, therefore in wanting to believe that the genetic material found at the crime scene, necessarily belongs to the killer. 

It concerns the misunderstanding of probabilistic information: the error arises when you exchange the probability of having the characteristics of guilt with the probability of being guilty, precisely because in possession of the characteristics of guilt. 

e.g. in 1894 Dreyfus, an officer of Jewish origin, was accused of revealing secrets related to the German defense. A forensic expert calculated the probability of obtaining that particular combination of letters found in the document belonging to Dreyfus, assuming the latter's innocence and that that combination of letters was random.

Specifically in the judicial process, laboratory analysis tends to be considered as highly reliable evidence, and that is why it is often a fallacy of the accuser. in particular, this fallacy is found when the judge is presented with evidence analysed in the laboratories that lead to the individualization of a guilty person, but without taking into account the possible uncertainties found in them. Here another problem can also be connected here: that of non-distinctive, which should be done, between classification and individualization, where the first is to indicate a class of individuals who have the same trait including the suspect himself, while the individualization refers to the identification of a specific individual as guilty. In the criminological field, both of these categories are used, therefore, one often falls into what is called a fallacy of individualization.

An example of the accuser's fallacy is the case of Troy Brown, who was suspected of raped a 9-year-old girl.
The evidence against him was just starting, except for a match from NA. Despite this a verdict of guilt was issued mainly because of the claim supported by the prosecution, which said that there was only one NA profile out of 3 million compatible with the one found. Here is a clear example of the accuser's fallacy because the random match probability has been calculated, which is the probability that a person chosen at random has the same blood type as the one found at the crime scene, but it has been interpreted as the probability of innocence given the evidence. That's because if the defendant had been innocent, there would have been one in every 3 million chance of finding a match.

The k of possible causes must form a partition of the sample space, in the sense that the causes must be incompatible (which do not occur at the same time) and exhaustive (that from their union comes the certain event).

The Bayesian approach to forensic sciences allows to study the probability of the prosecution and defence hypothesis, taking into account the evidence, during investigations and trials. 

The Bayesian approach is summarized as follows: the relationship between the probabilities a posteriori (probability that the hypothesis of the prosecution has occurred given the evidence, divided by the probability that the hypothesis of the defense has occurred taking into account the proof) is equal to the product of the relationship between the probabilities a priori (presumption of innocence in which the evidence is not considered) and the relationship of probability (i.e. the probability that there is a match of NA, taking into account the hypothesis of the accusation and the defense). 

The accuser's fallacy consists of calculating P(E""HD), i.e. the probability that there is a NA match taking into account the hypothesis of innocence, and interpreting it as the suspect's probability of innocence, taking into account the evidence. 

an example is the case of Lucia de B.: the statistician considers 1 out of 342 million as the probability of Lucia's innocence taking into account the test, in fact that number is P(E""HD), that is the probability that there is a NA match even if Lucia is innocent.",100.0,stita,1.0,100,876,1199,903,855,932,1203

If it is true that the accused was innocent, then there would be a probability in 3 million of a correspondence of NA and MP does not refer to the final hypothesis that the accused was innocent or guilty, but only at the origin of the trace of NA.
The accuser's fallacy consists in calculating P(E""Hd) = P(evidence"" innocence) and reinterpreted as P(innocence"" evidence) where Hd: defence hypothesis and E: evidence, evidence.","A fallacy of the accuser (or conditional transposed) means an error that is made in the application of the Bayes theorem and that consists in calculating P(E""Hd) (probability of evidence since the accused is innocent) and interpreting it as P(Hd""E) (probability that the accused is innocent given the evidence). In particular, in order to explain what is meant it is possible to refer to a historical case of fallacy of the accuser, that is to say that relating to the Dreyfus case. He was an officer of Jewish origin employed at the French Ministry of War, who was accused of having revealed secrets related to the defense to the Germans, following the discovery of an anonymous and undated memorandum. Marie Bastien cleaning woman, at the embassy decided, after the discovery of the bordered in a trash paper basket, to forward it to the major. On October 13, 1894, Dreyfus was accused of having written the bordered letter and, above all, he thought that the bordered letter contained an encrypted message, as the letters of the alphabet appeared more frequently than they would in the normal French prose. In this regard Berillio decided to try to calculate the probability that those letters had been combined in that particular way by chance and that the defendant was therefore innocent. The calculation provided for binomial distributions and was obtained in fact a value of 1/625. It was considered too small a value and therefore the defendant was innocent. In fact, the fallacy of the accuser was occurring as the conditioner was being exchanged with the conditioner. In a second appeal in 1904 a memory written by three wise men did justice to this fallacy, affirming the correct principle of truthfulness. Garbolino rebuilt the case and posed as P(A)=1/100 E P(ONA)=99/100. It was then passed from an evidentiary value to a ratio of the probabilities a posteriori, indicating how the defendant was 6 times more guilty and therefore from these data the calculation of the probability that the defendant was guilty given the evidence.",100.0,stita,1.0,100,941,1273,958,923,996,1277
,"The fallacy of the accuser is a very common example of error (cognitive bias in the forensic field) that occurs particularly during the trials and consists in calculating, assuming that the accused is innocent, the probability of proof given by the hypothesis of the defense (the probability that there may be a match of NA if the accused is innocent) and reinterpreted as the probability of innocence given the evidence (the probability that he is innocent if there is a match of NA).

The sampling scheme in this case is that of extraction from an urn, and before extraction the sample unit is a random variable that will have a probability distribution equal to the frequency distribution of the variable X studied in the population. If I assume to repeat the extraction n times, to have a sample with greater number to one, and perform the extraction with re-entry in such a way that the different extractions are independent from each other, I will have that the random variables that make up the sample are all independent and identically distributed (i.i.d).

For example, if you want to perform a clinical test to evaluate the effectiveness of a new medicine in terms of healing or not healing, where the probability of success, then of healing, is ""p"" and the probability of failure, then of not healing"" is (1-p). If you give the medicine to a patient this will be a random variable that will be distributed as a Bernoulli and in case of healing it will take value 1 and in case of non-healing it will take value 0.
If I hypothesize the test to n patients with similar characteristics, they will all be individually equal chances of success or failure, so they will all be random variables independent and identically distributed (i.i.d)
In the case of sampling from the theoretical population I cannot make a choice but I have to make a sample survey, because if, for example, I wanted to determine the lifespan of light bulbs produced by a company and assume to do them on all the bulbs produced, it would mean to turn on and measure the time that comes to their break, but in this way destroy production and it would not be a reasonable behavior.",100.0,stita,1.0,100,835,1078,855,844,892,1080
